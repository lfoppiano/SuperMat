        <p>The coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in the <rs type="material">isovalent-P-substituted BaFe 2 (As 1−x P x ) 2</rs> has been investi- gated microscopically by 31 P-NMR measurements. We found that <rs type="tc">superconducting (SC) transition</rs> occurs in a magnetic region with static ordered moments and that the moments are reduced below the <rs type="tc">SC transition temperature</rs> <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in the samples near the phase boundary of magnetism and superconductivity. Our results indicate that magnetism and su- perconductivity coexist spatially but compete with each other on the same Fermi surfaces. The coexistence state is qualitatively different from that observed in other unconventional superconductors and gives a strict constraint on the theoretical model for superconductivity in <rs type="material">BaFe 2 (As 1−x P x ) 2</rs>.</p>

      <p>The newly discovered <rs type="class">iron-pnictide</rs> high-T c superconduc- tivity appears where antiferromagnetism is suppressed by chemical substitution or pressure. Within various <rs type="class">iron- pnictide</rs> superconductors, we have focused on the <rs type="material">isovalent- P-substituted BaFe 2 (As 1−x P x ) 2</rs> system and carried out comprehensive NMR studies on the system. This is because the <rs type="material">isovalent P substitution</rs> introduces a negligible change in carrier concentration but changes magnetic interactions sys- tematically. In addition, very clean single crystals are avail- able for various measurements. By investigating the spin dy- namics probed via P-NMR as a function of P concentration, we showed that the <rs type="tc">maximum T c</rs> is observed at the P concen- tration at which magnetic order vanishes; thus, we suggested that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations associated with quantum criticality play a central role in obtaining high-T c su- perconductivity. We consider that the study of the coexistence of mag- netism and superconductivity, which is observed in the phase boundary, would give important information about the super- conducting (SC) properties and mechanism. There are ex- perimental reports not only from macroscopic and neutron scattering measurements but from microscopic measure- ments of the coexistence and competition of magnetism and superconductivity in <rs type="class">iron pnictides</rs>. We point out that diffraction measurements give magnetic moments averaged over a wider spatial region and cannot provide microscopic information about the coexistence. It remains an open ques- tion whether an SC phase transition occurs in a magnetic re- gion of a sample or the superconductivity in a magnetic region is induced by the penetration of a nonmagnetic SC region and whether the same or different electronic states contribute to magnetism and superconductivity. In this paper, we report the occurrence of the SC transition in a magnetic region of the spin-density-wave (SDW) ordering, which is concluded from the investigation of internal field and nuclear spin-lattice re- laxation rate 1/T 1 by site-selective NMR measurements.</p>
      <p>We used <rs type="material">BaFe 2 (As 0.80 P 0.20 ) 2</rs> and <rs type="material">BaFe 2 (As 0.75 P 0.25 ) 2</rs> , which are located near the phase boundary as shown in Fig. . We used a collection of single crystals (∼100 mg) for our NMR measurements. The preparation of the single-crystal samples is described in the literature. The P concentration values were determined using an energy-dispersive X-ray an- alyzer and confirmed by lattice-constant measurements since they follow Vegard's law. Figures show the tem- perature dependence of the <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> ρ xx values of the <rs type="material">x = 0.20 and 0.25</rs> samples. The structural and magnetic transi- tions were determined from the anomalies in the tempera- ture derivative of ρ xx and are plotted in Fig. . The mag- netic transition temperature derived from ρ xx is in good agree- ment with the NMR results shown later. Each single crystal was fixed randomly with a GE varnish to prevent preferential alignment in the applied magnetic field due to the anisotropy of magnetization and the SC Meissner effect. The ac <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x15">suscep- tibility measurements</rs> indicate <rs type="tc">nonbulk superconductivity</rs> at <rs type="pressure">ambient pressure</rs> but <rs type="tc">bulk superconductivity</rs> at <rs type="tc">T * c</rs> ∼ <rs corresp="#x15,#x22" type="tcValue" xml:id="x20">13 K</rs> at P ∼ <rs corresp="#x20" type="pressure">2 GPa</rs> in the <rs type="material" xml:id="x22">x = 0.20</rs> sample [Fig. ].

Note that the Meissner signal saturates at low temperatures, indicative of bulk super- conductivity in these samples. The NMR spectrum becomes broader and inhomogeneous below the magnetically ordered temperature T N . To detect a site-selective electronic state in the inhomogeneous state, we measured the 31 P nuclear spin- lattice relaxation rate 1/T 1 across the resonance signal. We applied as small RF fields as possible for the site-selective 1/T 1 measurements in order to obtain the recovery curve of nuclear <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> with a single T 1 component.</p>

      <p>ing magnetic fields. A single sharp spectrum was observed above T N , but no anomaly was detected in the NMR spec- trum at the structural transition T S determined by ρ xx . Below T N , a broad NMR spectrum with a Gaussian shape develops gradually and coexists with a sharp peak at around <rs type="tc">T on c</rs> ∼ <rs corresp="#x28" type="tcValue">30 K</rs>. We measured 1/T 1 at the sharp and broad peaks shown by the solid black and dashed red arrows, respectively. Figure shows the temperature dependence of (T 1 T ) −1 at those peaks. (T 1 T ) −1 measured at the sharp peak continues to in- crease down to <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , indicative of the absence of a magnetic order at T N , but (T 1 T ) −1 at the broad peak shows a kink at T N , indicative of the presence of a magnetic order. These re- sults suggest that the sharp (broad) NMR peak arises from the region where P concentration is slightly higher (lower) than <rs type="material">x = 0.25</rs>. Thus, the two-peak structure around <rs type="tc">T on c</rs> is as- cribed to the spatial distribution of the P concentration, since the variation in T N is very steep against the P concentration, as seen in Fig. .</p>
      <p>The 31 P-NMR spectrum in the AFM state gives informa- tion about the ordered moments, since the internal field at the P site originates from the moments. The shape of the spec- trum reflects the field distribution at the P site; thus, it is related to the magnetic structure of the moments. The aver- age of the internal field is related to the magnitude of the ordered moment, which is the order parameter of the AFM state. Since we used randomly oriented samples for the mea- 31 lar NMR spectrum is expected when the ordered moments are in a commensurate structure. Such a rectangular NMR spectrum was actually observed in slightly P-substituted sam- ples, such as the <rs type="material">x = 0.07</rs> sample. The broad Gaussian- shaped NMR spectrum indicates the distribution of the in- ternal field at the P site and suggests an incommensurate spin structure. The magnetic structure changes from a com- mensurate structure to an incommensurate structure (SDW type) with the P substitution. The averaged internal field H int at the P site is coupled with the ordered moment M as H int = A hf M with the hyperfine coupling constant A hf ∼ 0.32 T/µ B . H int is evaluated from the increase in the second moment ∆H 2 of each NMR spectrum be- low T N H int (T ) ≡ ∆H(T &lt; T N ) 2 − ∆H(T N ) 2 , and ∆H 2 is determined as where g(H) denotes the NMR intensity against magnetic fields and H av is the center of gravity of the NMR spectrum.</p>
      <p>Figure shows the temperature variations in H int and es- timated M using A hf . H int increases below T N but de- creases below <rs type="tc">T * c</rs> ∼ <rs type="tcValue">14 K</rs>. (T 1 T ) −1 measured at the magnetic broad signal decreases clearly below ∼ 14 K, as shown in Fig. , indicative of the occurrence of superconductivity in the magnetic region of the sample. In addition, we measured (T 1 T ) −1 across the 31 P-NMR spectra at 20 K (&gt; T * c ) and 5 K (&lt; T * c ), as shown in Figs. and 2(e), and confirmed that (T 1 T ) −1 in all regions of the spectrum at 5 K is smaller than that at 20 K. This indicates that superconductivity occurs over the entire region of the sample. The sharp decrease in (T 1 T ) −1 at T * c means that superconductivity is a phase transition in the magnetic region and excludes the possibility that supercon- ductivity in the magnetic region is induced by the penetration of the SC region in the sample.</p>
      <p>A similar nature of coexistence of magnetism and super- conductivity was also observed in the <rs type="material">x = 0.20</rs> sample at a pressure of <rs type="pressure">∼ 2 GPa</rs>. Figures show the field- swept NMR spectra and the temperature dependence of the H int at the P site and estimated M , which are determined by the same procedure as that in the case of the <rs type="material">x = 0.25</rs> sam- ple. For comparison, H int at <rs type="pressure">ambient pressure</rs> is also shown in Fig. . H int increases below T N ∼ 73 K (60 K) at am- bient pressure (P ∼ 2 GPa) but decreases below <rs type="tc">T * c</rs> ∼ <rs corresp="#x58" type="tcValue" xml:id="x56">13 K</rs> at P ∼ <rs corresp="#x56" type="pressure">2 GPa</rs>, as observed in the <rs type="material" xml:id="x58">x = 0.25</rs> sample. It should be noted that the paramagnetic signal was not observed at all in the sample, indicating that the entire region of the <rs type="material">x = 0.20</rs> sample at P ∼ 2 GPa is in the magnetic state below T N and then shows superconductivity below <rs type="tc">T * c</rs> . These results indi- cate the microscopic coexistence of magnetism and supercon- ductivity, and the suppression of the magnetic order parameter below <rs type="tc">T * c</rs> both for the <rs type="material">x = 0.25</rs> sample at <rs type="pressure">ambient pressure</rs> and for the <rs type="material">x = 0.20</rs> sample at P ∼ <rs type="pressure">2 GPa</rs>. Now, we compare the present results with experimental results in other <rs type="class">iron pnictides</rs> and unconventional supercon- ductors. It was revealed by muon spin rotation (µSR) that strongly disordered but static magnetism coexists with su- perconductivity in the narrow range of <rs type="material">0.1 &lt; x &lt; 0.13 on SmFeAsO 1−x F x</rs> with the "<rs type="class">1111</rs>" structure. However,</p>

      <p>neither the suppression of the ordered moments below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> nor the SC transition in a magnetic region was observed in <rs type="material">SmFeAsO 1−x F x</rs> . The suppression of the ordered moments below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , which is observed in <rs type="material">BaFe 2 (As 1−x P x ) 2</rs> , was also reported in <rs type="material">Ba(Fe 1−x Co x ) 2 As 2</rs> by neutron scattering mea- surements and in <rs type="material">Ba 1−x K x Fe 2 As 2</rs> by µSR measurements. The competition between the magnetic and SC order pa- rameters as well as the spatial coexistence are common fea- tures of the "122" compounds. It thus seems that the re- lationship between the magnetic and SC phases is differ- ent between the "1111" and "122" compounds. The spatial coexistence is also realized in heavy-fermion superconduc- tors, whereas the nature of coexistence differs from that in <rs type="material">BaFe 2 (As 1−x P x ) 2</rs> , i.e., magnetism and superconductivity oc- cur at different parts of the Fermi surfaces. For example, it was reported that the spatial coexistence is observed microscopi- cally in <rs type="material">CeCo(In 1−x Cd x )</rs> and <rs type="material">CeRhIn 5</rs> at a certain pres- sure, where T N is higher than <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . In these compounds, the magnetically ordered moments develop below T N ; how- ever, they become constant below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> without further change at low temperatures. This suggests that magnetism and su- perconductivity emerge from different parts of the Fermi sur- faces, thus a single 4 f state could satisfy the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity. The suppression of the or- dered moments below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> was not observed in the U-based su- perconductor <rs type="material">UPd 2 Al 3</rs> or <rs type="material">UNi 2 Al 3</rs> , where plural 5 f electrons are subdivided into localized and itinerant electrons. This is also the case in ferromagnetic superconductors, such as <rs type="material">UGe 2</rs> , URhGe, and <rs type="material">UCoGe</rs>. In contrast, the suppres- sion of the ordered moments below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> can be well understood by the assumption that the same Fermi surfaces contribute to both magnetic ordering and superconductivity with a compet- itive relationship. In <rs type="material">BaFe 2 (As 1−x P x ) 2</rs> , cylindrical Fermi surfaces, particularly hole Fermi surfaces, are modified to be more three-dimensional, and nesting between hole and elec- tron Fermi surfaces becomes weaker with P substitution, re- sulting in the suppression of the AFM order. It is considered that the nesting vector becomes distributed and the AFM or- der (superconductivity) occurs at stronger (weaker) nesting vectors. In this regard, the competitive relationship between the two phases might have a common aspect with that in <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductors, whose AFM order is induced by the applied strong magnetic field that imposes the vortex lat- tice.</p>
      <p>The competition between superconductivity and AFM or- dering near the phase boundary can be described in terms of a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory of coupled order param- eters. The homogeneous part of the free energy is given by where ∆ and M denote the SC and AFM order parameters, respectively. The leading term in the order-parameter compe- tition is characterized by the coefficient γ, which determines the phase diagram and the character of two phase transitions; SC and AFM states coexist homogeneously with two second- order phase lines for 0 &lt; γ &lt; √ u s u m , but two phases compete and are separated by a first-order transition for γ &gt; √ u s u m .</p>
      <p>Our experimental results, indicating the homogeneous coexis- tence and presence of the AFM and SC transitions at different temperatures, conclude that the former (0 &lt; γ &lt; √ u s u m ) con- dition is realized in <rs type="material">BaFe 2 (As 1−x P x ) 2</rs>. According to the recent theoretical studies, an extended s-wave (s ± -wave) state, in which the SC gap changes sign between the hole and elec- tron bands, satisfies the 0 &lt; γ &lt; √ u s u m condition and can co- exist with an incommensurate SDW state over a much wider range of parameters than a conventional s-wave state. In fact, the temperature dependence of M can be fit with the GL expression in the case of homogeneous coexistence, as shown in Figs. with red curves. In this sense, our results are consistent with the s ± -wave state.</p>

The red curve is the fit with the GL model in the case of homogeneous coexistence 30, 31 [(M(T )/M 0 ) 2 = A(T N − T ) + B(T − T * c ) with M 0 = 0.33 µ B , A = 1.87 × 10 −2 K −1 , and B = 8.74 × 10 −2 K −1 ].

The coex- istence behavior is consistently interpreted by the s ± model. As far as we know, <rs type="class">iron-pnictide</rs> superconductors with the "122" structure are the first examples that magnetic ordered moments are significantly suppressed by the occurrence of su- perconductivity, although such coexistence has been expected from theoretical studies. Our results strongly suggest that antiferromagnetism and superconductivity occur at the same Fermi surfaces and compete with each other.</ab>
