          <p>Muon spin rotation (µSR) measurements of the in-plane penetration depth λ ab have been per- formed in the electron-doped infinite layer high-Tc superconductor (HTS) <rs type="material">Sr0.9La0.1CuO2</rs>. Absence of the magnetic rare-earth ions in this compound allowed to measure for the first time the abso- lute value of λ ab (0) in electron-doped HTS using µSR. We found λ ab (0)=116(2) nm. The zero- temperature depolarization rate σ(0) ∝ 1/λ 2 ab (0)=4.6(1) µs −1 is more than four times higher than expected from the Uemura line. Therefore this electron-doped HTS does not follow the Uemura relation found for hole-doped HTS.</p>

      <p>The high-T c <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductors are obtained by doping holes or electrons into the antiferromagnetic (AF) insulating state. Both electron and hole-doped <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> share a common building block, namely the copper- oxygen plane and one would expect that the same pairing mechanism is applicable. There are a number of impor- tant differences, however, between the generic phase di- agrams of the electron-doped and hole-doped materials. In order to elucidate the mechanism of high-T c super- conductivity (HTS), it is very important to clarify the origin of similarities and differences between hole-doped (p-type) and electron-doped (n-type) <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>.</p>
      <p>The magnetic field penetration depth λ is one of the fundamental lengths of a superconductor, related to the superfluid phase stiffness ρ s ∝ 1/λ 2 , or what is often re- ferred to as superfluid density n s /m * ∝ 1/λ 2 (supercon- ducting carrier concentration n s divided by the effective mass m * ). Accurate and precise measurements of the absolute value of λ(T → 0) are very important for un- derstanding superconductivity in <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>. The muon- spin-rotation (µSR) technique provides a powerful tool to measure λ in type II superconductors. Detailed µSR investigations of polycrystalline HTS have demonstrated that λ can be obtained from the muon spin depolarization rate σ(T ) ∝ 1/λ 2 (T ), which probes the second moment of the magnetic field distribution in the mixed state . One of the most interesting result of µSR investigations in HTS is a remarkable proportionality between <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and the zero-temperature depolarization rate σ(0) ∝ 1/λ 2 (0) for a wide range of p-type underdoped HTS (so-called Uemura line) . This observation indicates that the superfluid density is an important quantity which deter- mines <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in HTS. This is not expected in conventional BCS theory and therefore the Uemura relation has an important implication for the physics of HTS .</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it is not known up to now whether the n-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> also obey the Uemura relation. The large dynamic relaxation due to rare-earth magnetic moments in n-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> <rs type="material">R 2−x Ce x CuO 4−δ (R= Nd, Sm, Pr)</rs> with so called T ′ -structure prevented the determination of σ(0) in µSR experiments . Because of this prob- lem, other techniques like microwave surface impedance and <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> were used to determine the penetra- tion depth in n-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>. However, it is difficult to determine the absolute value of λ with these experiments and the reported values vary in a very wide range from 100 to 300 nm even for optimally doped samples. There- fore there is no consensus about the penetration depth value for n-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>. Another difficulty concerns the quality of the samples. A long-standing mystery for the T ′ -structure n-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> is the effect of an oxygen reducing procedure. Superconductivity shows up only when a minute amount (∆y ≈ 0.02) of interstitial oxy- gens are removed by the reducing procedure . The role of the tiny amount of interstitial oxygen is not clear up to now. The control of the oxygen content requires rather extreme conditions, such as temperatures as high as 850 • -950 • C in Ar, which is not far below the sintering temperature. Therefore the control of the sample quality and reproducibility becomes a serious problem.</p>
      <p>There exists another class of n-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> <rs type="material">(Sr,Ln)CuO 2 (Ln=La, Sm, Nd, Gd)</rs> with so-called infinite-layer structure . The n-type <rs type="class">infinite-layer superconductors</rs> (<rs type="class">ILS</rs>) have several merits. First, the simplest crystal structure among all HTS consisting of an infinite stacking of CuO 2 planes and (Sr, Ln) layers. The charge reservoir block commonly present in <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> does not exist in the infinite-layer structure. Second, the stoi-chiometric oxygen content without vacancies or intersti- tial oxygen . Third, n-type <rs type="class">ILS</rs> have much higher <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ≃ <rs corresp="#x11" type="tcValue">43 K</rs> compared to the n-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> with T ′ -structure <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ≃ <rs type="tcValue">25 K</rs>. Although n-type ILS have existed for quite a while, not many studies of their physical properties were performed because of the lack of high-quality sam- ples with a complete superconducting volume. Recently, high-quality n-type ILS samples of <rs type="material" xml:id="x11">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> with a sharp <rs type="tc">superconducting transition</rs> <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ≃ <rs corresp="#x11" type="tcValue">43 K</rs> were syn- thesized by using a cubic multi-anvil press .</p>
      <p>In this letter we report studies of the penetration depth λ in <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> ILS using the transverse-field (TF) µSR technique. We confirmed microscopically that this compound is a bulk superconductor. Because of the absence of magnetic rare-earth ions, it was possible to measure the penetration depth in n-type HTS for the first time using µSR, yielding λ ab (0)=116(2) nm. The zero-temperature depolarization rate σ(0)=4.6(1) µs −1 is more than four times larger than expected from the Uemura plot. This shows that the n-type ILS does not follow the Uemura relation established in p-type HTS.</p>
      <p>The polycrystalline samples <rs type="material" xml:id="x16">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 (SLCO)</rs> for this study were prepared with the high-pressure tech- nique using a cubic multi-anvil press . <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x17">Magnetiza- tion measurements</rs> showed a single sharp <rs type="tc">superconduct- ing transition</rs> at <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ≃ <rs corresp="#x16,#x17" type="tcValue">43 K</rs> and the saturation of the sus- ceptibility at low temperatures indicating the good sam- ple quality. The µSR measurements were performed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI, Switzerland) using low- momentum muons (29 MeV/c). A detailed discussion of the TF-µSR technique is given in where details of the application of the technique to the determination of λ can be found. shows TF-µSR muon-spin precession signals in an applied field of 600 mT above and below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . For vi- sualization purposes the apparent precession frequencies are modified from the actual precession frequencies by the use of a rotating reference frame. In the normal state above <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , the oscillation shows a small relaxation due to random local fields from nuclear magnetic moments. Below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , the relaxation rate strongly increases due to the inhomogeneous field distribution of the flux line lat- tice. It is well known that in n-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> there is a competition between the antiferromagnetically ordered state and superconductivity . The static magnetism, if present, could enhance the muon depolarization rate and falsify the interpretation of the TF-µSR results. We have therefore carried out zero-field (ZF) µSR experi- ments to determine whether such static magnetism exists in <rs type="material">SLCO</rs>. Typical ZF-µSR spectra are shown in for temperatures above and below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . The ZF relaxation is exponential with a small relaxation rate 0.149(4) µs −1 and 0.184(5) µs −1 at 50 and 2.5 K, respectively. Thus, there is no evidence for the static magnetism in <rs type="material">SLCO</rs> down to 2.5 K. Moreover, the ZF relaxation rate is small and changes very little between 50 and 2.5 K. Therefore, the increase in TF relaxation rate below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is attributed entirely to the vortex lattice.</p>

      <p>Detailed µSR experiments in polycrystalline HTS have shown that the internal field distribution in the mixed state can be well approximated by a Gaussian distribu- tion . We used two Gaussian model for analyzing our asymmetry time spectra: where A i represent the asymmetries of the two compo- nents, σ i the muon depolarization rates, B i the local magnetic fields at the muon sites, γ=135.5 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio and ϕ the initial phase. The solid lines in show the best fits to Eq. (1). The fit is statistically satisfactory (χ 2 criterion), as can be seen qualitatively in . Analysis of the asymmetry time spectra showed that below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in the present <rs type="material">SLCO</rs> sample more than 80 % of the muons stop in the superconducting regions (first component). In this regions the internal magnetic field is smaller than the external one because of the diamag- netic screening and the depolarization rate is much higher than in the normal state because of the flux-line lattice formation. The rest 20 % of the muons (second com- ponent) oscillate with a frequency nearly equal to that corresponding to the applied magnetic field with a much smaller depolarization rate. This signal is most probably coming from the muons stopping in the nonsupercon- ducting grain boundaries and other defects in the struc- ture and is often observed in polycrystalline HTS . As already mentioned samples of <rs type="class">ILS</rs> prepared so far suf- fer from the small volume fraction of the superconduct- ing phase. As a real space microscopic probe µSR can distinguish between the superconducting and nonsuper- conducting phases and determine their relative volume fractions. The present µSR measurements provide mi- croscopic evidence for the excellent quality of the <rs type="material">SLCO</rs> <rs type="class">ILS</rs> prepared with the cubic multi-anvil press technique .</p>
      <p>In polycrystalline samples the effective penetration depth λ ef f (powder average) can be extracted from the µSR depolarization rate σ ∼ λ −2 ef f . It was shown that in polycrystalline samples of highly anisotropic sys- tems such as the HTS (γ=λ c /λ ab &gt; 5), λ ef f is domi- nated by the shorter penetration depth λ ab and λ ef f = 1.31λ ab . Recent magnetization measurements in grain- aligned <rs type="material">SLCO</rs> showed a rather high anisotropy value γ=9 . Therefore the measured λ ef f is solely deter- mined by the in-plane penetration depth λ ab .</p>
      <p>The relation between σ and λ ab is only valid for high magnetic fields (B ext &gt; 2µ 0 H c1 ), when the separation be- tween vortices is smaller than λ. In this case, according to the London model σ is field independent . To check for this, we measured σ as a function of the applied field at T=10 K. Each point was obtained by field-cooling the sample from above T c to 10 K. The inset of shows that σ strongly increases with increasing magnetic field up to B ext ≃50 mT and above 50 mT changes very little with magnetic field. Such a behavior is expected within the London model and is typical for polycrystalline HTS . It can be seen that above 50 mT σ(B) shows a ten- dency of gradual decrease with increasing field. This can be due to the increase of λ with magnetic field due to the anisotropic order parameter and the associated non- linear effect due to the Doppler shift of the quasiparticles in the nodal region . However, the field range in our experiment is too narrow to discuss this in more de- tail. Based on the σ(B) measurements, we studied the temperature dependence of σ in a magnetic field of 600 mT (the largest available field of the GPS spectrometer at PSI). We choose the highest magnetic field because at higher fields the enhanced vortex-vortex interaction helps to maintain the long-range order of the vortex lat- tice, which is important for the determination of λ. shows the temperature dependence of the muon spin depolarization rate σ(T ) at B ext =0.6 T. The values of σ(T ) were derived after subtraction of the small nor- mal state temperature-independent depolarization rate</p>

      <p>originating from the copper nuclear moments (σ(T ) 2 =σ 2 1 - σ 2 norm ). From the data in extrapolated to 0 K we obtain the value σ(0)=4.6(1) µs −1 which corre- sponds to λ ab (0)=116(2) nm. The value σ(0)= 4.6(1) µs −1 is one of the highest among all HTS. shows <rs type="tc">T c</rs> plotted versus σ(0) (Uemura plot ) for p-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>, including the present result for <rs type="material">n-type SLCO</rs>.</p>
      <p>One can see that <rs type="material">SLCO</rs> strongly deviates from the Ue- mura line. It is interesting to consider the situation in n-type HTS with the T ′ -structure. As we already men- tioned it was not possible to extract the value of λ in this type of compounds with µSR, and most of the ex- periments were performed by means of microwave sur- face impedance technique which yielded very controver- sial results due to the difficulty to extract the absolute values of λ. There are however two studies of λ(0) in <rs type="material">Nd 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 4 (NCCO) single crystals</rs> by means of <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> and infrared optics . We included in these λ(0) values converted to σ(0). It is seen that similar to <rs type="class">ILS</rs> <rs type="material">SLCO</rs>, <rs type="material">n-type NCCO</rs> with the T ′-structure strongly deviates from the Uemura line. This was also pointed out by Homes et al. from the optical measurements . Based on the presented results one can conclude that n-type HTS do not follow the Uemura relation established in p-type HTS.</p>
      <p>There are several important differences between the normal-state properties of the p-and n-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>. The p-type materials show T -linear in-plane <rs type="me_method">electrical re- sistivity</rs> and incommensurate magnetic fluctuations whereas the T ′ n-type materials show a T 2 depen- dence of the in-plane <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> and commensurate magnetic fluctuations .

      <p>n-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> found no evidence of the pseudogap in contrast to p-type materials . Present results show that the differences between the p-and n-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> extend also to the superconducting state. Namely, we observed that in n-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> the superfluid density n s /m * is more than four times larger compared to p-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> with the same <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . Finally let us comment the temperature dependence σ(T ) presented in . One can see that at low tem- peratures (below ∼15 K) σ(T ) is not constant and instead follows the linear temperature dependence. Usually a lin- ear low-temperature behavior of σ(T ) is taken as an in- dication for a d-wave gap function with line nodes . However, experience with p-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> showed that the single crystals are required for conclusive determi- nation of the intrinsic temperature dependence of σ and hence of the λ using µSR technique . Unfortunately, <rs type="material">single crystals of SLCO</rs> are not available at present. Con- cerning the pairing symmetry in <rs type="material">SLCO</rs> based on other experiments, we note that the recent tunneling exper- iments suggest strong-coupling s-wave pairing in <rs type="material">SLCO</rs> . On the other hand, NMR spin-lattice relaxation and Knight shift measurements were found to be more con- sistent with the line-nodes gap . It remains to be un- derstood why different experimental techniques provide controversial results concerning the pairing symmetry in <rs type="material">SLCO</rs>.</p>
      <p>In summary, we performed TF-µSR measurements of the in-plane penetration depth λ ab in n-type <rs type="class">ILS</rs> <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> . Absence of the magnetic rare-earth el- ements in this compound allowed to measure for the first time the absolute value of λ ab (0) in n-type HTS using µSR. We found λ ab (0)=116(2) nm. The zero- temperature depolarization rate σ(0) ∝ 1/λ 2 (0)= 4.6(1) µs −1 is more than four times higher than expected from the Uemura line. Therefore this n-type HTS does not follow the Uemura relation in contrast to p-type HTS. We also performed ZF-µSR experiments and found no evidence of magnetic order in <rs type="material">SLCO</rs>. This indicates the competitive character of AF order and superconductivity in n-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> in agreement with the recent neutron scattering experiments .</p>
