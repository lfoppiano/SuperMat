          <p>A series of high-quality <rs type="material">La2−xSrxCuO4 (LSCO)</rs> superconductor crystals in the under-doping region with <rs type="material">x = 0.063, 0.07, 0.09, 0.10, 0.111 and 0.125</rs> has been successfully prepared by traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ) technique. The crystals are large and free of sub-grains and foreign phases. The high crystal quality has been revealed by double-crystal x-ray rocking curves and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry combined with ion- beam channeling effect. We find that the evolutions of the superconducting transition width and volume fraction as a function of carrier concentration exhibit interesting anomalies in the vicinity of some "magic number" doping levels such as <rs type="material">x = 1/4 2 (=0.0625) and 1/3 2 (=0.111)</rs>. We argue that these behaviours are of intrinsic electronic origin.</p>

        <p><rs type="material">La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO)</rs> system is known to be one of the cuprate superconductor systems with fewer components and a simple layered structure of K 2 NiF 4 type which can be basically described as a stacking of single-plane CuO 2 superconduct- ing layers separated by two (La, Sr)O layers. The intrinsic Josephson junctions of <rs type="material">LSCO</rs> have re- cently been characterized as stacked serial SIS junctions , and its high Josephson plasma fre- quency in THz region is quite interesting for de- veloping new electronic devices such as THz gen- erators and detectors . On the other hand, its electronic states strongly depend on hole-doping which can be achieved with the substitution of Sr 2+ cations for La 3+ ones. At very low doping (<rs type="material">x &lt; 0.02</rs>), <rs type="material">La 2−x Sr x CuO 4</rs> is an antiferromag- netic Mott insulator. After crossing a spin glass state (<rs type="material">0.02 &lt; x &lt; 0.05</rs>) , it <rs type="tc">becomes a super- conductor</rs> (<rs type="material">0.05 &lt; x &lt; 0.26)</rs> and then changes to a normal metal (<rs type="material">0.26 &lt; x &lt; 0.6</rs>) and fi- nally it behaves as a semiconductor (<rs type="material">x &gt; 0.6</rs>) . In the superconductor regime, the <rs type="tc">critical temperature</rs> of <rs type="material">LSCO</rs> reaches its maximum of <rs corresp="#x15" type="tcValue">38 K</rs> at <rs type="material" xml:id="x15">x = 0.15</rs>. The investigation on the doping dependences of low temperature physical proper- ties in both normal and superconducting states is important for acquiring a better understanding of high T C superconductivity and strongly cor- related electron systems. <rs type="material">LSCO</rs> system is there- fore not only attractive in its possible applications but also in such fundamental research. For both purposes, high-quality and sizable single crystals are highly demanded, and persistent effort has been made in the crystal growth using differ- ent techniques . Traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ) method is widely accepted as a unique approach to growing such incongru- ent melting oxide superconductor crystals. This crucible-free technique avoids the crystal contam- ination from crucible material that will otherwise interfere with the observation of intrinsic phys- ical properties. The large temperature gradient produced by focused lamp images makes possible good solid-liquid interfaces and a stable molten zone.</p>
        <p>By using TSFZ method, we have success- fully prepared a series of large and high-quality <rs type="material">La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 single crystals</rs> covering some in- teresting under-doping levels (<rs type="material">x = 0.063 -0.125</rs>) with the aim of systematic investigation on the physical properties. We first report here the re- sults of TSFZ growth and characterizations of some properties of these <rs type="material">LSCO</rs> crystals. Inter- esting anomalous doping dependences of super- conducting properties are observed in this series of crystals and are briefly discussed.</p>
        <p>High purity (≥ 99.99%) <rs type="class">oxides</rs> La 2 O 3 , CuO and <rs type="class">carbonate</rs> SrCO 3 were used as the raw ma- terials. For the feed rods, the initial composition was <rs type="material">(1-x/2)La 2 O 3 /xSrCO 3 /CuO in molar ratio with x = 0.063, 0.07, 0.09, 0.10, 0.111 and 0.125</rs>. Excess CuO of 1 -2 mol% was added for com- pensating its evaporation loss in the growth pro- cess. The solvents were much richer in CuO as self-flux, typically of 78 mol% CuO. In determin- ing the Sr contents of the solvents, we took into account the previously reported results of distri- bution coefficients k Sr of Sr doping into <rs type="material">La 2 CuO 4</rs> . The Preparation of dense and homogeneous feed rods is one of the key factors in achieving a stable and continuous TSFZ growth. Each step in the preparation was carefully checked and op- timized, such as thorough mixing and grinding of the starting and prefired powders by a planetary ball mill, forming compact cylindrical rods under a high hydrostatic pressure before the feed rods being finally well sintered. An infrared heating floating-zone furnace with a quartet ellipsoidal mirror (Crystal Systems Inc., Model FZ-T-10000-H) was used for TSFZ experiments. The crystals were grown under an oxygen pressure of 0.2 MPa at a zone traveling rate of 0.8 mm/hr using seed crystals orientated along orthorhombic or tetrag- onal [100] or [110] directions.</p>
        <p>By careful operations and the use of high qual- ity feed rods, a stable molten zone was success- fully maintained in most experiments until pro- ceeding growths were artificially stopped just be- fore the whole feed rods, typically 125 mm long, ran out. Shown in is the photo for one of as-grown ingots, with a typical size of 5-6 mm in diameter and 110 mm in length. Polished crystal pieces cut from the ingots were checked by optical microscopy using polarized or normal light. No grain boundaries were observed in the crystallized ingots after several centimeters away from the starting point of crystallization on seed crystals, indicating that large single-grain crys- tals were obtained. The compositions of grown crystals estimated by ICP-AES were very close to those of feed rods, and no foreign phases in crystal samples were detected by powder XRD analysis.</p>

        <p>Experiments of x-ray rocking curves were per- formed on representative <rs type="material">La 1.91 Sr 0.09 CuO 4 (x = 0.09)</rs> crystal using a double-crystal diffractometer (Rigaku, Model SLX-1) equipped with a 12 KW rotating Cu target and a Ge (004) monochroma- tor (α ∼ 5 o ). shows the rocking curve of (008) Bragg reflection for this sample having a surface dimension of 4mm × 15mm (the beam slit size was set to 0.5mm × 10mm). The full- width-at-half-maximum (FWHM), which is cor- related with the crystal mosaicity, is as small as 0.10 o . This is one of the best data reported so far for <rs type="material">LSCO crystals</rs> . The quality of the same crystal was also examined by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry combined with ion- beam channeling effect (RBS-channeling) which was carried out using 2 MeV well collimated He ion beam and a Si detector set at 160 o to the in- cident direction. The channeling spectrum was taken along the c-axis of the crystal. The RBS- channeling minimum yield is only χ min = 3.8% , being another evidence for the high quality of the crystal. Moreover, it can be seen from that, for the aligned spectrum, the backscattering counts increase very slowly with depth. This is a strong indication that the defect density in the crystal is very low.</p>

        <p>The Meissner (field-cooled) and shielding (zero- field-cooled) signals of all the six crystal sam- ples were measured on a <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x24">SQUID magnetometer</rs> (Quantum Design, MPMS XL) in a low field of 5 Oe with c/H, as shown in . The <rs type="tc">super- conducting critical temperatures</rs> observed from the Meissner effects range from about <rs corresp="#x24,#x26" type="tcValue">11K</rs> for <rs type="material" xml:id="x26">x = 0.063</rs> to about <rs corresp="#x24,#x27" type="tcValue">31K</rs> for <rs type="material" xml:id="x27">x = 0.125</rs>. It is of much interest to note that, around some spe- cial doping levels with "magic numbers" such as <rs type="material">x = 1/4 2 (=0.0625)</rs> and <rs type="material">1/3 2 (=0.111)</rs>, the su- perconducting transitions are much sharper (∆T ≈ 2K) than those at the doping contents away from them and the Meissner fraction drops re- markably upon doping in the close vicinity of <rs type="material">x = 1/3 2</rs> . Moreover, the shielding sig- nals exhibit the same broadening trend for the doping levels away from the magic numbers and they all have 100% volume fraction. This indi- cates that there is no macroscopic inhomogene- ity and/or weak links. Generally speaking, crys- talline imperfection may broaden superconduct- ing transition and a narrow transition width is</p>

        <p>expected for superconductor crystals of high qual- ity. We have evidenced that the <rs type="material">x = 0.09 LSCO crystal</rs> is of excellent crystalline perfection, but, contrary to the expectation, it exhibits a broad superconducting transition. As a further check, the <rs type="material">La 1.91 Sr 0.09 CuO 4</rs> sample was annealed under various conditions for several to twelve days at 600-1000 o C under oxygen flow or 0.3 MPa oxy- gen pressure before quenched in liquid nitrogen. However, <rs type="me_method">magnetic measurements</rs> showed that its transition width remained unchanged after these annealing processes. These results and observa- tions thus lead us to conclude that such anoma- lies of superconducting properties in the vicin- ity of these magic doping levels as well as the broad transitions at the dopant contents away from these magic numbers are of intrinsic elec- tronic origin. At these special carrier concentra- tions, some specific electronic state may occur but it may not be completely pinned down elsewhere in this doping region. Indeed, both supercon- ducting electronic phase separations and the formation of 2D electronic lattices at magic doping numbers are reported in Sr doped and Sr/O co-doped <rs type="class">lanthanum cuprates</rs>. Further related investigations are currently in progress.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, we have successfully prepared by TSFZ method a series of high-quality <rs type="material">La 2−x Sr x CuO 4</rs> superconductor crystals in the under-doping regime with <rs type="material">x = 0.063 -0.125</rs>. The crystals are pure, subgrain-free and large in size. We have observed from the <rs type="me_method">magnetic measure- ments</rs> that the <rs type="tc">superconducting transition</rs> width narrows in the close vicinity of some magic dop- ing levels while remains broad at other dopant contents, and the Meissner fraction shows an un- usual decrease around <rs type="material">x = 1/3 2</rs> . We suppose that such interesting anomalous behaviours in su- perconducting state may probably originate from some intrinsic electronic state occurring at these special carrier-dopings.</p>
