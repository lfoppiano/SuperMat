Temperature Dependence of the Magnetic Penetration Depth in the Vortex State of the Pyrochlore Superconductor, Cd 2 Re 2 O 7
We report transverse field and zero field muon spin rotation studies of the superconducting rhe- nium oxide pyrochlore, Cd2Re2O7. Transverse field measurements (H=0.007 T) show line broaden- ing below Tc, which is characteristic of a vortex state, demonstrating conclusively the type-II nature of this superconductor. The penetration depth is seen to level off below about 400 mK (T /Tc ∼ 0.4), with a rather large value of λ(T = 0) ∼ 7500Å. The temperature independent behavior below ∼ 400 mK is consistent with a nodeless superconducting energy gap. Zero-field measurements indicate no static magnetic fields developing below the transition temperature.
The pyrochlore transition metal oxides, of general for- mula A 2 B 2 O 7 , have been the topic of much interest in recent years as they represent ideal systems for study- ing the effects of geometrical frustration . Both the A and B sublattices form a network of corner-sharing tetra- hedra such that it may not be possible to energetically satisfy all the magnetic interactions simultaneously. The resultant geometric frustration leads to the formation of exotic ground states. Much of the recent work has con- centrated on local moment systems where novel proper- ties such as cooperative paramagnetism , partial, non- collinear antiferromagnetic ordering , spin-freezing , and dipolar "spin-ice" behavior have been ob- served. There has, however, been growing interest in the interplay between itinerant and local moments in geo- metrically frustrated systems. The metallic pyrochlore
Nd 2 Mo 2 O 7 exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect which has been attributed to the Berry phase produced by spin chirality on the pyrochlore lattice , while the spinel compound, LiV 2 O 4 has been claimed to represent the first known transition metal heavy-fermion system and evidence exists that the unusual properties of this mate- rial are related to geometrical frustration on the spinel lattice. A vast body of work has been carried out on 3d and 4d transition metal pyrochlores. These are generally in- sulators and possess either a spin-glass-like or long-range ordered magnetic structure. In contrast, the 5d transition metal pyrochlores are mainly metallic, resulting from the extended nature of the 5d orbitals. The exception to this is Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 where the 5d 3 configuration of Os 5+ results in a half-filled t 2g band and a metal-insulator transition at 226 K. Despite the large number of transi- tion metal compounds which crystallize in the pyrochlore structure and the wide range of physical phenomena ob- served in these materials, superconductivity had not been observed until the recent discovery of bulk superconduc- tivity in the 5d pyrochlore, Cd 2 Re 2 O 7.
Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 crystallizes in the pyrochlore structure with room temperature lattice constant a=10.219Å and an oxygen positional parameter x=0.3089.Recent inves- tigations have demonstrated the ex- istence of two phase transitions in this compound. The first, occurring at a temperature of about 200 K, is a continuous structural transition which is accompanied by drastic changes in resistivity and magnetic suscep- tibility . On further lowering the temperature, Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 has been shown to exhibit bulk superconduc- tivity below a sample dependent transition temperature of about 1 K . Preliminary measurements in the superconducting state indicate that Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 is a type-II superconductor with H c1 less than 0.002 T and estimates of the upper critical field, H c2 , ranging from 0.2 T to 1 T . None of the measurements reported to date extend below 0.3 K (T /T c ∼0.3) and hence, little can be concluded about the symmetry of the order parameter in this system. An exponential form of the specific heat as T approaches zero was speculated by Hanawa et al. but they point out that measurements to lower temperatures are clearly needed. We report the first measurements on Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 below 300 mK, tem- peratures which are necessary (for T c ∼ 1 K) to extract information about the superconducting order parameter symmetry. We have performed transverse field (TF) and zero field (ZF) muon spin rotation (µSR) measurements on single crystal samples of Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 . The ZF-µSR measurements reveal very small internal magnetic fields which are characteristic of nuclear dipoles, indicating no significant electronic magnetism either above or below T c . The TF-µSR results provide the first measurement of the internal field distribution in the vortex state in this material. In particular, temperature dependent studies from 20 mK to 4 K indicate a penetration depth which levels off as T → 0, suggestive of a fully gapped Fermi surface with a rather large zero temperature value of the penetration depth, λ(0)∼7500Å.
Muon spin rotation has proven to be a very effective probe in the study of superconductivity . In partic- ular, TF-µSR provides a measure of the length scales associated with type-II superconductors, the penetration depth, λ and the vortex core radius r 0 . In a TF-µSR experiment, spin polarized muons, with polarization per- pendicular to the applied magnetic field direction, are implanted in a sample at a location which is random on the length scale of the vortex lattice. The muon precesses at a rate proportional to the local magnetic field provid- ing a measure of the local field distribution, n(B). The presence of the vortex lattice results in a spatially inho- mogeneous field distribution and a resulting muon spin depolarization.
Early TF-µSR measurements assumed a Gaussian dis- tribution of magnetic fields and with this approximation, the penetration depth can be directly obtained from the Gaussian depolarization rate, σ ∼ 1/λ 2 . This approx- imation has been shown to be reasonable for the case of polycrystalline samples but is inadequate for the case of single crystals . In this case, a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model has been developed to model the magnetic field distribution for a single crystal. In GL theory, the size of the vortex core is determined by the applied mag- netic field, H, and the GL coherence length normal to the applied field, ξ GL , while the penetration depth provides the length scale of the decay of magnetic field away from the vortex core. The field distribution is calculated from the spatial distribution of magnetic field , where is the flux quantum and S is the area of the reduced unit cell for a hexagonal vortex lattice.
Single crystals of Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 were grown using vapor- transport techniques as described elsewhere . Three samples with an approximate surface area of 5×5 mm 2 each were mounted using low temperature grease

such that the cubic (100) direction would be parallel to the applied magnetic field direction. They were mounted on intrinsic GaAs in order to eliminate any precession sig- nal at the background frequency from muons which miss the sample and would otherwise land in the Ag sam- ple holder. The samples were covered with 0.025 mm Ag foil which was bolted to the sample holder to ensure tem- perature uniformity. The TF and ZF-µSR measurements were performed in an Oxford Instruments dilution refrig- erator on the M15 beamline at TRIUMF at temperatures from 20 mK up to 4 K.
Given the estimated critical field values, we selected a field value of 0.007 T and the temperature dependence was measured by cooling the sample in the presence of this applied magnetic field to ensure a uniform flux line lattice. show typical µSR spectra in a transverse field of 0.007 T, for temperatures above and below T c respectively. Examination of this data clearly shows an enhanced depolarization rate on entering the superconducting state resulting from the inhomogeneous field distribution associated with the flux line lattice. This represents the first experimental observation of the vortex lattice in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 and provides clear evidence

that this material is a type-II superconductor. The ob- served increase in the TF line broadening below T c can be attributed entirely to the vortex lattice since the ZF muon spin relaxation rate (not shown here) was small and roughly temperature independent below 2 K.
The solid lines shown in and (b) represent fits of the individual time spectra to a sample signal con- sisting of a Gaussian envelope with fixed asymmetry and a background signal with fixed linewidth and asymme- try. The background, from muons which miss the sample and land in the heat shields, was obtained independently by performing measurements with the sample removed. The resulting sample linewidth, σ, is shown in as a function of temperature. As one can clearly see, the magnitude of the depolarization rate as T → 0 is very small, saturating at a value of about 0.1 µs −1 . The residual linewidth from nuclear dipoles, taken from the data above T c , is very small in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 (about 0.03 µs −1 ), allowing for clear observation of the line broaden- ing associated with the flux line lattice. Apparently the muons stop in sites which are not close to the Re ions, which have appreciable nuclear moments.
As can be seen from Eq. 1, the field distribution de- pends on both the penetration depth and GL coherence depth. The GL coherence length can be obtained from the known value of the upper critical field using the ex- pression ξ GL = (Φ 0 /2πH c2 ) 1/2 where Φ 0 is the flux quan- tum. As mentioned above, a range of values for H c2 have been reported and consequently, to provide a self- consistent measurement of λ, the field dependence of the linewidth was measured. To account for any possible instrumental field-dependence in the linewidth, measure- ments were made above the transition temperature (2 K) at each field value after which the sample was field- cooled to 100 mK. The measured linewidth in the nor- mal state was subtracted in quadrature from that ob-

served at 100 mK and the results are plotted in as a function of applied magnetic field. As can be clearly seen, the linewidth decreases almost linearly with applied field. This is attributed to the linear increase in the vol- ume taken up by the vortices. The linewidth parameter, σ F C , approaches zero at a field of 0.5 T which is our estimate of H c2 (T→0) and is consistent with measure- ments on other samples. This estimate of the critical field corresponds to ξ GL ∼ 260Å. Using this value, we obtain the penetration depth using the field distribution shown in Eq. 1. The resulting temperature dependent penetration depth is shown in . As expected from the small values of linewidth, at the base temperature we observe a rather large value of the penetration depth, λ(0) ∼ 7500Å. We note that this value of penetration depth is significantly larger than most oxide supercon- ductors where values ranging from 1000-2000Å are typ- ical .
As the penetration depth is related to the concentra- tion of superconducting carriers, its temperature depen- dence is a measure of the low-lying electronic excitations. As such, the presence of a nodeless superconducting en- ergy gap is indicated by a leveling off of the penetra- tion depth as the temperature decreases below T c . As is clearly seen in , the linewidth and penetra- tion depth respectively become temperature independent as the temperature decreases below about 0.4 K, consis- tent with a fully gapped Fermi surface. Consequently, we conclude that the superconducting order parameter in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 is consistent with a nodeless energy gap sug- gesting either s-wave symmetry or exotic pairing symme- tries, such as p-wave which can also exhibit a fully gapped Fermi surface. For comparison, the solid line in Figs. 2

and 4 represent fits to the two fluid approximation while the dashed line in is a fit to the BCS tem- perature dependence where ∆ 0 = 1.74(11) K. The London penetration depth, λ, provides a direct measure of the ratio of superconducting carrier concen- tration to effective mass, n s /m * , where ξ 0 is the Pippard coherence length, and l is the mean-free path. There is considerable uncertainty in estimations of the mean-free path with reported values ranging from 200-700Å and it is unclear whether Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 is a superconductor in the clean or dirty limit. If the material is in the clean limit, the present results provide strong evidence for a fully gapped Fermi surface. Under the assumption of a clean superconductor, such that ξ 0 /l ≪ 1, a value of n s m e /m * of 5.0×10 25 m −3 can be obtained using Eq. 4 and the measured penetra- tion depth. On the other hand, if l ∼200Å (i.e. the dirty limit) then we obtain ξ 0 ∼470Å and n s m e /m * ∼1.4×10 26 m −3 . Clearly, precise determination of the mean free path for Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 is needed to allow accurate quantita- tive information to be extracted.
In conclusion, we have performed µSR studies of the superconducting state in the recently discovered py- rochlore superconductor, Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 . Zero-field measure- ments indicate no significant magnetism in this super- conductor, suggesting that magnetic frustration does not play a direct role in the superconductivity. Transverse- field measurements show that Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 is a type-II su- perconductor and indicate a superconducting order pa- rameter consistent with a fully gapped Fermi surface with a zero temperature value of penetration depth of ∼7500Å. However, considering that the superconductor may be in the dirty limit, spectroscopic techniques which directly measure the density of states would be required to confirm this conclusion.
