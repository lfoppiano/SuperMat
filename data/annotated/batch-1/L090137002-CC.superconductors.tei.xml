		<p>The Josephson Plasma Resonance is used to study the c-axis supercurrent in the superconducting state of <material>underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O 8+δ</material> with varying degrees of controlled point-like disorder, introduced by high-energy electron irradiation. As disorder is increased, the Josephson Plasma frequency decreases proportionally to the <tc>critical temperature</tc>. The temperature dependence of the plasma frequency does not depend on the irradiation dose, and is in quantitative agreement with a model for quantum fluctuations of the superconducting phase in the CuO2 layers.</p>

		<p>From the d-wave symmetry of the order parameter of <class>cuprate</class> superconductors, one expects an enhanced sensitivity of c-axis transport in the superconducting state to disorder, due to the enhancement of the quasiparticle density of states along the gap node directions, and due to impurity assisted hopping . Both mechanisms lead to as yet unobserved T 2 -dependences of the c-axis superfluid density ρ c s at low T , with coefficients that strongly depend on the scattering rate Γ. On the other hand, underdoped <class>cuprates</class> are sufficiently disordered for (quantum) fluctuations of the order parameter phase to play a prominent role , leading to a Tlinear behavior of ρ c s . Here, we report on the effect of controlled point disorder on interlayer tunneling of Cooper pairs in <material>underdoped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ</material>.</p>
		<p>Single-crystalline rods of <material id="4">underdoped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ</material> were grown using the travelling solvent floating zone technique under 25 mBar oxygen partial pressure . The samples used for the study, with <tc>T c</tc> ≈ <tcValue ptr="#4">70 K</tcValue>, were cleaved from the same crystalline piece. The crystals were then irradiated with 2.5 MeV electrons using the van der Graaf accelerator of the Laboratoire des Solides Irradiés. The irradiation produces homogeneously distributed Frenkel pairs, which have previously been identified as strong scattering centers .</p>
		<p>The Josephson Plasma Resonance (JPR) frequency f JP R of the crystals was then measured using the cavity perturbation technique, exploiting T M 01n harmonic modes to access different frequencies , and the bolometric technique using a waveg-</p>
		<p><material>Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ crystals</material>, normalized to the JPR frequency at T → 0, versus reduced temperature. uide in the T E 01 travelling wave mode . The latter technique allows for swept-frequency measurements, necessary to elucidate the weak f JP R (T ) dependence at low T . Note that f 2 JP R is proportional to the c-axis critical current j c c and to the c-axis superfluid density: c ∝ ρ c s , with ǫ r the low-frequency dielectric constant and λ c is the c-axis penetration depth.</p>
		<p>Sharp JPR resonant peaks were measured for all samples under study. Both <tc>T c</tc> and f JP R (T → 0) decrease with irradiation dose. The sensitivity of f JP R to even weak additional disorder contradicts the model of coherent interlayer Cooper pair tunneling . Within the framework of a d-wave BCS model, the measured proportionality between f 2</p>
		<p>and <tc>T c</tc> can be understood as resulting either from (i) the dependence of the interlayer Josephson current j c c ∝ ∆σ qp on the gap magnitude ∆ and the quasiparticle conductivity σ qp , or (ii) from the decrease of the in-plane superfluid density due to strong phase fluctuations.</p>
		<p>The origin of the temperature and disorderdependence of f JP R can be pinpointed using . Normalising all results to f JP R (T → 0) and plotting these versus reduced temperature, reveals a common T -dependence independent of disorder. This contradicts the prediction of Ref.</p>
		<p>[1] that ρ s should follow different powers of T depending on the ratio of T , ∆, and Γ. However, it agrees with a dominant role of quantum phase fluctuations. Then, Jacobs et al., PRL 75, 4516 (1995)] σ = σs = 3.7 e 2 /h i.e. <material>Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ crystals</material>, plotted as 1−f 2 J P R (T )/f 2 J P R (0) in order to bring out the low temperature T -dependence. The line is a fit to Eq. 1 with parameters as indicated. where α = (∂ε 0 s/∂T ) T →0 , ε 0 = Φ 0 /4πµ 0 λ 2 ab with λ ab the in-plane penetration depth, s is the CuO 2 layer spacing, and σ = σs is the CuO 2 plane sheet conductivity . The temperature dependence of the JPR frequency arises from the temperature of the inplane phase stiffness ε 0 . shows that Eq. (1) describes the results very satisfactorily.</p>
		<p>Summarizing, the temperature-and disorder dependence of the c-axis Cooper pair tunnel current in underdoped <material>Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ</material> is well described assuming a strong effect of quantum phase fluctuations. A d-wave model without fluctuations cannot account for the T -dependence of c-axis coupling.</p>
