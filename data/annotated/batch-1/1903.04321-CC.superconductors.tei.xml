          <p>Though the superconducting phase of the type-II Dirac semimetal <rs type="material">PdTe2</rs> was shown to be con- ventional in nature, the phase continued to be interesting in terms of its magnetic properties. While certain experiments indicated an unexpected type-I superconducting phase, other experiments re- vealed formation of vortices under the application of magnetic fields. Recently, scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) experiments revealed the existence of a mixed phase where type-I and type-II behaviours coexist. Here, based on our temperature and magnetic field dependent STS experiments on <rs type="material" xml:id="x2">Cu-intercalated PdTe2</rs> we show that as the <rs type="tc">critical temperature</rs> of the superconducting phase goes up <rs corresp="#x2" type="tcValue">from 1.7 K to 2.4 K</rs> on Cu-intercalation, the mixed phase disappears and the system be- comes homogeneously type-II. This may be attributed to an averaging effect caused by quasiparticle exchange between type-I and type-II domains mediated by the <rs type="material">Cu</rs> atoms and to decreased coherence length due to increased disorder.</p>

        <p>The candidate type II Dirac semimetal <rs type="material" xml:id="x5">PdTe 2</rs> superconducts <rs corresp="#x5" type="tcValue">below 1.7 K</rs> . Though initial experi- mental papers suggested the possibility of an unconven- tional nature of the superconducting phase of <rs type="material">PdTe 2</rs> , a number of experiments confirmed that the superconduc- tivity in <rs type="material">PdTe 2</rs> is conventional in nature . How- ever, some of these experiments found evidence of type I behaviour as far as the magnetic properties of the su- perconducting phase of <rs type="material">PdTe 2</rs> are concerned . These contradicted with certain other experiments where the magnetic properties were found to be consistent with type II superconductivity . More recently, magnetic field dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy exper- iments revealed coexistence of type I and type II do- mains in <rs type="material">PdTe 2</rs> where such an inhomogeneity of the su- perconducting phase was attributed to electronic inho- mogeneities observed in the normal state of <rs type="material">PdTe 2</rs> . It turned out that the electronic inhomogeneity could alter the local electron density and the local coherence length thereby leading to a distribution of the Ginzburg-Landau-Abrikosov-Gorkov (GLAG) parameter (κ) over the surface of <rs type="material">PdTe 2</rs> . Within this picture, it should be possible to disorder the system so that inter-domain scattering of the quasiparticles can average out the κ dis- tribution and make the system homogeneous. In this pa- per, we report the observation of such averaging effect in <rs type="material">Cu-PdTe 2</rs> by magnetic field dependent scanning tun- neling spectroscopy experiments. The superconducting phase becomes homogeneously type II while the <rs type="tc">critical temperature</rs> gets enhanced at randomly distributed do- mains on the surface due to random distribution of the intercalates .</p>
        <p>The effect of Cu-intercalation on the electrical and thermal transport properties in <rs type="material">PdTe 2</rs> was investigated in detail in the past . Such measurements on polycrystalline samples indicated that the higher <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in <rs type="material">Cu-PdTe 2</rs> is due to enhanced electron-phonon coupling parameter (λ ph ) and increased density of states upon Cu- intercalation. For the spectroscopic measurements presented in this paper we used high quality single crys- tals of <rs type="material" xml:id="x18">Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 with 4% Cu</rs> in the crys- tals. The shiny single crystals were first mounted in a ultra-high vacuum (UHV) cleaving stage integrated with the STM. The crystals were then cleaved at 80 K us- ing a cleaver attached to an UHV manipulator. After cleaving, the crystals were immediately transferred to the STM head which is cooled down to 310 mK using a H 3 -based cryostat. The sample is placed at the center of a solenoidal superconducting magnet with a maximum field strength of 11 Tesla. All the STM/S experiments re- ported in this paper were performed with sharp metallic tips of tungsten (W). The tips were fabricated by electro- chemical etching and were cleaned by electron beam bom- bardment under UHV in a preparation chamber attached to the STM prior to the low temperature experiments. The formation of the superconducting phase with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x18,#x10000" type="tcValue" xml:id="x20">2.6 K</rs> is seen in the <rs xml:id="x10000" type="me_method">susceptibility</rs> versus temperature data presented in (b).</p>
        <p>In , we show an atomic resolution image of the surface of <rs type="material">Cu-PdTe 2</rs> . A careful inspection of this image reveals two types of defects -(i) triangular defects as in <rs type="material">PdTe 2</rs> and typical for <rs type="class">chalcogenides</rs> and (ii) dark spots surrounded by well defined patterns. While (i) were seen in <rs type="material">non-intercalated PdTe 2</rs>, (ii) are new and therefore originate from the intercalated Cu atoms. Clear image of the lattice captured from a defect-free region is shown in the inset of (a). The patterns formed around the Cu atoms could be an interference pattern caused by incoming quasiparticles and their counterparts scattered from the Cu atoms. We have investigated the energy dependence of such patterns in detail and found that the pattern does not disperse with energy. Hence, the states participating in formation of the patterns are most likely topologically trivial surface states.</p>
        <p>The scanning tunnelling spectroscopy revealed two types of spectra. One type captured at 310 mK is shown as a blue line in (c). The coherence peaks are clearly seen below which the differential con-</p>

        <p>ductance becomes zero indicating formation of a full gap , as expected for BCS superconductor. The spec- trum is fitted using Dyne's equation given by is the density of states at energy E, ∆ is the superconducting energy gap and, Γ is an effective broadening parameter incorporated to take care of slight broadening of the BCS density of states possibly due to finite quasi-particle life time . For the type of spectra shown in (c), the extracted value of ∆ is 0.53 meV. To note, the experimental spec- tra slightly deviate from the theoretical fits just above the coherence peaks -this deviation was not seen in case of <rs type="material">non intercalated PdTe 2</rs> . As we will discuss later, this type of spectra correspond to a higher <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ∼ <rs type="tcValue">2.4 K</rs>. At certain other points, the spectra are seen to be different and their analysis reveal a smaller ∆ ∼ 0.44 meV. These spectra also correspond to a lower <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ∼ <rs type="tcValue">1.7 K</rs>. The de- viation of the experimental data from the theoretical fits are seen for these spectra as well. For the spectra with smaller ∆, though the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> remains to be same as that of <rs type="material">pure PdTe 2</rs> , the gap is measured to be higher than in <rs type="material">pure PdTe 2</rs> (∼ 0.32 meV). Hence, the the effect of intercalation is present everywhere including the points where a lower <rs type="tc">T c</rs> (and lower ∆) is measured.</p>
        <p>From a comparative consideration of the results dis- cussed above, it appears that the superconducting phase with higher <rs type="tc">T c</rs> that is expected to emerge upon Cu- intercalation (as per bulk measurements) appears at sev- eral places (as in ) while, at several other places, the enhancement of superconducting properties is less (as in ). This suggests that the phase with higher <rs type="tc">T c</rs>, though does not arise uniformly throughout the crystals, exceeds the percolation threshold thereby contributing predominantly in bulk transport measure- ments. In order to search for a correlation between the domains with higher <rs type="tc">T c</rs> phase and the defect states due to Cu, we performed local spectroscopy near and away from such defects. It was observed that the higher <rs type="tc">T c</rs> phase appears more frequently in the Cu rich regions.</p>

        <p>One of the most intriguing features of the supercon- ducting phase of <rs type="material">PdTe 2</rs> is that despite hosting topologi- cally non-trivial bands crossing the Fermi surface, the superconducting order parameter is found to be con- ventional and is seen to follow BCS-like temperature dependence. The conventional nature of the tem- perature dependence is also found in case of the two en- ergy gaps that are measured in <rs type="material">Cu-intercalated PdTe 2</rs> . The temperature dependent spectra along with the the- oretical fits are shown in (a) for the phase with higher ∆ and in (b) for the phase with lower ∆. Surprisingly, in both the cases, while the lowest temper- ature spectra showed no additional features other than the sharp coherence peaks, at slightly elevated temper- atures a small zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP) is also seen to appear. When the emergence of the ZBCP is considered along with the slight deviation of the ex- perimental spectra from the theoretical fit, it is impor- tant to first investigate whether a tiny unconventional component in the order parameter can be present here. Such a ZBCP may appear due to a small unconventional component in the gap function that has a different tem- perature dependence than the dominating conventional component. In order to understand this point clearly, let us consider a temperature dependent gap amplitude given by ∆(T ) = α∆ s (T ) + β∆ un (T ), where ∆ s is the conventional component and ∆ un is the unconventional component of the gap, and α and β are the respective coefficients. Now, since the ZBCP does not appear at low temperatures, it is clear that at those temperatures, α∆ s β∆ un . Now, with increasing temperature, due to the possible difference in temperature dependence of ∆ s and ∆ un , at some point, the contribution of ∆ un may become comparable to ∆ s thereby making the un- conventional contribution detectable in the form of the ZBCP. Beyond this temperature, as shown in the data, all the spectroscopic features related to superconductiv- ity get systematically reduced with a complete disappear- ance of the spectral features at <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . It should be noted that while the possibility of an unconventional compo- nent cannot be ruled out, the ZBCP may also originate from other sources, like inelastic impurity scattering with non-trivial temperature dependence. Since no ZBCP is seen in <rs type="material">pure PdTe 2</rs> , here, the enhanced scattering may be due to the impurity states of the Cu intercalates. Since the strength of the ZBCP is significantly smaller than the overall spectra, we have fitted the temperature de- pendent spectra ignoring the ZBCP. The temperature dependent ∆ thus obtained, are plotted in (c) and (d) respectively for the larger ∆ and the smaller ∆. The red dots represent the measured values of ∆ and the solid lines show the expected temperature dependence within BCS theory, barring a slight devia- tion at higher temperatures. In both the cases, the tem- perature evolution of the spectra is consistent with BCS theory. From the measured valued of ∆ and <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , it is seen that ∆/k B T c are ∼ 2.56 and 3.15 corresponding to the larger ∆ and the smaller ∆ respectively. This means, the regions where the effect of intercalation is smaller, ∆/k B T c is higher. This shows that the elctron-phonon coupling strength decreases upon Cu-intercalation. This result apparently contradicts the theoretical finding of an enhanced electron-phonon coupling constant (λ ph ) in <rs type="material">Cu-intercalated PdTe 2</rs> . Therefore, our results sug- gest that the enhancement in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in <rs type="material">Cu-PdTe 2</rs> is primarily due to the enhanced density of states at the Fermi energy and not due to altered electron-phonon coupling. How- ever, these two processes may compete with each other giving rise to an effective enhancement of superconduct- ing properties in <rs type="material">Cu-PdTe 2</rs> . Now we focus on the magnetic field dependent spec- troscopic measurements on <rs type="material">Cu-intercalated PdTe 2</rs> . As it was discovered before, the surface of <rs type="material">pure PdTe 2</rs> hosts co-existence of domains with type I and type II super- conductivity. In the type I domains, the superconducting spectra suddenly disappeared under the application of a low magnetic field ∼ 250 Oe. In the type II regions, the spectra survived up to much higher magnetic fields and the spectral features were seen to disappear continuously. Such variation of the type of superconductivity based on magnetic properties could be attributed to inhomo- geneity of local coherence length (ξ). An inhomogeneous background possibly responsible for such inhomogeneity in ξ was found in the normal state conductance maps. Within this understanding, introduction of disorder into the crystal is expected to reduce ξ everywhere.</p>

        <p>In we show magnetic field dependent tunnelling conductance spectra captured at 310 mK at three different points on the surface of <rs type="material">Cu-PdTe 2</rs> . In all cases, the conductance spectra, regardless of the corre- sponding superconducting energy gaps and <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , evolved systematically and smoothly with magnetic field. The spectral features continuously became less prominent eventually disappearing at a critical field characteristic for the point where the spectroscopic measurement was performed. The critical fields measured in these cases are 10 kG, 17 kG and 4.5 kG respectively. The ubiquitously observed very low critical field (∼ 220 Oe) in <rs type="material">PdTe 2</rs> was not detected on any point in <rs type="material">Cu-PdTe 2</rs> . It should be noted that the measured critical fields at different points is much larger than the expected "surface critical field" (H s ∼ 1.7H c ) in BCS superconductors. Hence the enhancement is not due to a naturally enhanced sur- face critical field. In (c), we also show Dyne's fit of one set of the magnetic field dependent spectra and the variation of the superconducting energy gap with in- creasing magnetic field is shown in (d), where the smooth disappearance of the gap is clearly visible. This observation indicates that the superconductivity of <rs type="material">Cu-PdTe 2</rs> has become uniformly of type II throughout the crystal upon intercalation of Cu. This is different from the mixed type I and type II superconducting phase that was observed in <rs type="material">pure PdTe 2</rs> . The observation of the uniformly type II behaviour of the superconducting phase upon Cu-intercalation sup- ports the idea that the mixed type I and type II phase in <rs type="material">pure PdTe 2</rs> originated from a distribution of the local coherence length (ξ) and consequent distribution of κ. Introduction of disorder in the lattice causes increased scattering and a consequent decrease in the electronic mean free path (l) leading to a decreased ξ following the relation 1/ξ = 1/ξ 0 + 1/l, where ξ 0 is the BCS coher- ence length in the absolute clean limit. When the local ξ in the type I regions decrease, the GLAG parameter (κ) also decreases and consequently these regions should show magnetic properties of that of type II supercon- ductors. The criteria for the transition from a type I to a type II superconducting state in terms of the mean free path (l) has been discussed elsewhere where it was also shown that beyond a critical value of l, the super- conducting phase is expected to become homogeneously type II.</p>
        <p>Another aspect of the magnetic field dependence of ∆ that needs attention is a sudden change in ∆ at H ∼ 100 Oe, where ∆ decreases to almost 50 % of the zero field value. In a type II superconductor, such a sudden change may be associated with the emergence of a su- perconducting vortex in an area very close to the STM tip thereby causing the suppression of local ∆. As shown in the Γ vs. H plot in (d), as ∆ shows a sud- den drop, Γ shows a simultaneous upward jump (by a factor of 6) at approximately the same magnetic field. Γ represents pair breaking mechanisms leading to finite quasiparticle lifetime. Hence, this observation is consis- tent with the field-induced pair breaking under the STM tip, possibly due to the emergence of a nearby vortex core. However, despite our repeated attempts, we did not find spectra with clear zero-bias conductance peak in presence of magnetic field. To note, such zero-bias peaks in presence of sufficiently large magnetic field were frequently observed in <rs type="material">pure PdTe 2</rs> . It is possible that in case of <rs type="material">Cu-PdTe 2</rs>, the nature of the vortex core spectrum changes and becomes featureless and hence remains un- detectable in our experiments. Beyond the field at which the sudden change happens, both ∆ and Γ change grad- ually and beyond a certain field Γ becomes larger than ∆ thereby suppressing the key spectroscopic features.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we have performed detailed scan- ning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy on Cu- intercalated crystals of <rs type="material">PdTe 2</rs> at different temperatures and magnetic fields. The motivation was to address the fate of the intriguing magnetic properties of <rs type="material">PdTe 2</rs> upon Cu-intercalation. We found that Cu-intercalation en- hances the <rs type="tc">critical temperature</rs> throughout the crystal surface. In addition to <rs type="tc">T c enhancement</rs>, due to increased disorder, the surface of <rs type="material">Cu-intercalated PdTe 2</rs> becomes uniformly type II with no signature of co-existing type I phase anywhere. The effective critical field at all points becomes higher than that in the type I phase of <rs type="material">pure PdTe 2</rs> . The results support the idea that the magnetic properties and electronic structure in <rs type="material">PdTe 2</rs> surface are highly correlated and the peculiar magnetic properties reported before are a consequence of such correlation.</p>
