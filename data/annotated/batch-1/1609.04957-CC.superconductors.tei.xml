We studied whether spin fluctuations are involved in increasing <rs type="tc">Tc</rs> under a pressure of <rs corresp="#x8" type="pressure">3.0 GPa</rs> by using the 75 As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique. The 75 As-NMR results for the powder samples show that <rs type="tc">Tc</rs> increases <rs type="tcValue">up to 48 K</rs> with- out the influence of spin fluctuations. This fact indicates that spin fluctuations are not involved in raising <rs type="tc">Tc</rs>, which implies that other factors, such as orbital degrees of freedom, may be important for achieving a high <rs type="tc">Tc</rs> of <rs type="tcValue">almost 50 K</rs>.</p>

        <p>The phase diagram of the electron-doped high- transition-temperature (<rs type="tc">T c</rs> ) <rs type="class">iron-based pnictide</rs> <rs type="material">LaFeAsO 1−x H x</rs> (<rs type="class">H-doped La1111 series</rs>) is unique owing to the capability of electron doping: (i) It exhibits a superconducting (SC) phase with double domes covering a wide H-doping range <rs type="material">from x = 0.05 to x = 0.44</rs> 1 , (ii) the SC phase is sandwiched by antiferromagnetic (AF) phases appearing in heavily and poorly electron-doped regimes [see Fig. 1(a)] , and (iii) the application of pressure transforms the double domes into a single dome . Intriguingly, upon applying pressure, the <rs type="tc">minimum T c</rs> at <rs corresp="#x21" type="pressure">ambient pressure</rs> becomes the <rs type="tc">maximum T c</rs> of <rs type="tcValue" xml:id="x21">over 45 K</rs>, as shown by the solid arrow in Figs. 1(a) and as described in detail below. The unique features established in this compound have</p>

AF and SC represent antiferro- magnetic and superconducting phases, respectively. The ar- row in (a) shows the enhancement of <rs type="tc">Tc</rs> that occurs <rs type="pressure">between ambient pressure and 3.0 GPa</rs>.</ab>
        <p>not been observed so far in other <rs type="class">iron-based pnictides</rs>, such as the <rs type="class">Ba122</rs> and <rs type="class">Na111 series</rs>, which have been in- vestigated intensively from an early stage because they are available as large crystals. The electronic phase di- agram of the <rs type="class">Ba122 series</rs> is similar to that of high-T c <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> . The analogy is reminiscent of the impor- tance of AF fluctuations in <rs type="class">iron-based pnictides</rs>. The spin-fluctuation-mediated mechanism is a major candi- date for the high-T c mechanism. In fact, the SC phase of the <rs type="class">Ba122 series</rs> partially overlaps the AF phase, in other words, the SC and AF states are compatible, and the <rs type="tc">maximum</rs> <rs type="tc">T c</rs> occurs close to the phase boundary [see (b)] . Because of this special location, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is en- hanced and low-energy AF fluctuations simultaneously become predominant as the doping level approaches the AF phase . The <rs type="class">Na111 series</rs> has a phase diagram sim- ilar to that of the <rs type="class">Ba122 series</rs>; however, the SC phase overlaps the AF phase over a wide doping range and even extends to the undoped material . By tuning pressure, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and AF fluctuations are found to be related in a similar manner as in the <rs type="class">Ba122 series</rs> . A pressure-enhanced <rs type="tc">T c</rs> occurs in the <rs type="class">11 series</rs> <rs type="material">FeSe</rs>, which is superconducting and has no magnetic orders at ambient pressure. At first sight, the series seems to be free from the antiferromag- netism; however, at pressures exceeding 1 GPa, the SC phase is adjacent to the AF or AF+SC phase . In fact, the influence of AF fluctuations is observable in the SC phase even at <rs type="pressure">ambient pressure</rs> .</p>
        <p>AF fluctuations seem to play a key role in <rs type="tc">raising T c</rs> for various <rs type="class">iron-based pnictides</rs>; however, the scenario does not work well for <rs type="material">LaFeAsO 1−x F x</rs> , because for <rs type="material" xml:id="x45">x = 0.14</rs>, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> increases <rs corresp="#x45" type="tcValue" xml:id="x47">up to 40 K</rs> at <rs corresp="#x47" type="pressure">3.0 GPa</rs> with no predom- inant AF fluctuations . The <rs type="class">La1111 series</rs> under high pressure is the only material available for investi- gating the magnetic properties of <rs type="class">pnictides</rs> with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in the range of <rs type="tcValue">45-50 K</rs>. In fact, the <rs type="class">Sm1111 series</rs> marks the <rs type="tc">highest T c</rs> (<rs type="tc">T c</rs> =<rs type="tcValue">55 K</rs>) in all types of <rs type="class">iron-based pnic- tides</rs> ; however, it includes magnetic Sm ions, which</p>

        <p>hinders the investigation of the magnetic properties of iron-basal planes. The rise of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> without AF fluctuations was observed only for <rs type="material">x = 0.14</rs> (see the dashed arrow in ), because AF fluctuations remain in a lower dop- ing range than <rs type="material">x = 0.14</rs> and unfortunately <rs type="material">x = 0.14</rs> is nearly the highest level of <rs type="material">F</rs> doping. So far as nuclear- magnetic-resonance (NMR) studies on <rs type="material">LaFeAsO 1−x F x</rs> are concerned, the maximum doping level is less than <rs type="material">x = 0.14 − 0.15</rs> . To establish the breakdown of this scenario over a wide doping range (<rs type="material">0.20 ≤ x ≤ 0.44</rs>) that covers the second SC dome, we applied 75 As (I=3/2) NMR to the powder samples of the <rs type="class">H-doped La1111 se- ries</rs> at <rs type="pressure">3.0 GPa</rs>.</p>
        <p>We applied a pressure of <rs type="pressure">3.0 GPa</rs> to samples with <rs type="material">x =0.20, 0.40, and 0.44</rs>. The pressure was applied by us- ing NiCrAl-CuBe hybrid piston-cylinder-type cells. We used a mixture of F-70 and F-77 fluorinate as the pres- sure mediation liquid. The details of the pressure cells are given in Ref. . A coil wound around the samples inside the pressure cell and capacitors equipped with a NMR probe form the tank circuit, which serves to de- tect the detuning of the resonance frequency, namely the ac susceptibility and to detect the NMR signal as well. The NMR measurements were performed using a conventional coherent pulsed-NMR spectrometer. The 75 As-NMR spectra show a broad powder pattern with double edges , which originates from the second-order quadrupole effect under a magnetic field. The relaxation time (T 1 ) for 75 As was measured by using the saturation- recovery method at the lower-field edge in the field-swept NMR spectra. The low-field edge appears at about 48.2 kOe for an NMR frequency of 35.1 MHz. The signals at</p>

        <p>the low-field edge come from the powder samples with the iron-basal planes parallel to the applied field. Fig- ures 2(a)-2(c) show the evolution of the relaxation rate (1/T 1 ) divided by temperature (T ), ( i.e., 1/T 1 T ). Here, we chose <rs type="tc">T c</rs> as the onset of 1/T 1 T as plotted as arrows in Figs. 2(a)-2(c). For <rs type="material">x =0.20</rs>, 1/T 1 T just above <rs type="tc">T c</rs> exhibited plateaus as shown by dotted lines in , and <rs type="tc">T c</rs> was remarkably enhanced upon applying pres- sure. For <rs type="material">x =0.40 and 0.44</rs>, an anomaly was observed in a paramagnetic state as marked as T * , and both T * and <rs type="tc">T c</rs> were unchanged upon applying pressure. For <rs type="material">x=0.44</rs>, Curie-Weiss-like behavior, which implies AF fluctuations, appears above T * at <rs type="pressure">0.1 MPa</rs>; however, this behavior has no appreciable effect on <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . Note that <rs type="tc">T c</rs> was determined under the applied field. In general, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> decreases more or less under an applied field; however, the decrease is significantly suppressed be- cause we measured 1/T 1 T for the powder samples with the iron-basal planes parallel to the applied field. In fact, the values of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> are in good agreement with those de- termined from the detuning of resonance frequency at zero field. In this measurement, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> can be determined from the extrapolation as shown as dashed lines in 3(a)-3(c). shows the doping dependence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> determined from the <rs xml:id="x10000" type="me_method">resistivity</rs> 1 and 1/T 1 T . The data at <rs type="pressure">3.0 GPa</rs> for the low-doping regime are cited from the results of the <rs type="class">F-doped La1111 series</rs> . As highlighted by the solid arrow in , <rs type="tc">T c</rs> increases to <rs corresp="#x10000" type="tcValue" xml:id="x7-698">48K</rs> at <rs corresp="#x7-698" type="pressure">3.0 GPa</rs>, which is comparable to the <rs type="tc">highest T c</rs> (<rs type="tcValue">∼55 K</rs>) for all types of <rs type="class">iron-based</rs> superconductors marked in the <rs type="class">Sm1111 series</rs>.</p>
        <p>In general, 1/T 1 T of d-electrons systems is determined by spin correlations and is expressed by using the imagi- nary part of the dynamical spin susceptibility Imχ(q, ω) as 1/T 1 T ∝ Imχ(q, ω N )/ω N , where ω N is the angular fre- quency of nuclei. When the interaction between electrons is significantly strong, namely spin fluctuations are pre- dominant, Curie-Weiss-like behavior is derived, whereas, when the interaction is week, 1/T 1 T is determined by the density of states (DOS) at Fermi surfaces. Unlike other <rs type="class">pnictides</rs>, Curie-Weiss-like behavior is not observ- able for <rs type="material">x = 0.20</rs> as seen in . Another example is <rs type="material" xml:id="x103">K y Fe 2−x Se 2</rs> with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x103" type="tcValue">30 K</rs> : The compound exhibits similar T dependence to the <rs type="class">La1111 series</rs>. The results in demonstrate that <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is enhanced without appreciable low-frequency AF fluctuations, which is the most important result for this study. The absence of AF fluctuations has also been confirmed from the neutron- scattering measurements in both <rs type="material">LaFeAsO 1−x H x</rs> and <rs type="material">LaFeAsO 1−x F x</rs> : An inelastic-scattering peak is absent for <rs type="material">x =0.20</rs>, despite the fact that it is unambiguously ob- servable near the AF phase.</p>
        <p>Herein, the T dependence of 1/T 1 T is attributable to the DOS. The monotonous T dependence at high temperatures is attributed to the DOS involved only at high temperatures. In fact, the photoemission spec- troscopy measurements demonstrate that the DOS for <rs type="material">LaFeAsO 1−x F x</rs> decreases with decreasing temperature . This scenario is approved by quantitative evaluation of 1/T 1 T just at the plateau. We evaluate 1/T 1 T using the Korringa relation for d-electron alloys : where γ N , A hf and n i (ε F ) represent the gyromagnetic ra- tio of 75 As (7.292 MHz/10 kOe), the hyperfine coupling constant and DOS at Fermi surfaces for i = d xy , d yz , and d zx orbits, respectively. The factor α Q is Iχ(Q) where I is the interaction between electrons and χ(Q) is the susceptibility without the interaction at dominant wave number Q. The value of A hf has been estimated to be ∼25 kOe/µ B from the K − χ plot . The theoretically calculated values of n i (ε F ) for <rs type="material">x =0.20</rs> at <rs type="pressure">ambient pres- sure</rs> are 0.62, 0.92, and 0.92 (eV −1 ), respectively, for i = d xy , d yz and d zx orbits 1 . These values result in 1/T 1 T = 4.96 × 10 −4 1 (1−αQ) 2 (s −1 K −1 ). The plateau of 1/T 1 T at <rs type="pressure">0.1 MPa</rs> indicates 0.018 (s −1 K −1 ), and thus α Q = 0.83. The value is in good agreement with the the- oretically estimated value α Q = 0.94 for <rs type="material">x = 0.20</rs> . At high temperatures, 1/T 1 T at <rs type="pressure">3.0 GPa</rs> is almost the same</p>

At <rs type="pressure">0.1 MPa</rs>, the values of 1/T 1 T at <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , (1/T 1 T ) c are 0.023 and 0.018 (s −1 K −1 ) for <rs type="material">14% F-and 20% H-doped</rs> sam- ples, respectively. At <rs type="pressure">3.0 GPa</rs>, these numbers increase to 0.030 and 0.044, respectively. These data are plotted in (b). The data for <rs type="material">40% and 44% H-doped</rs> sam- ples are also plotted for comparison. As seen from the figure, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> correlates with (1/T 1 T ) c only for <rs type="material">14% F-and 20% H-doped</rs> samples reflecting n i (ε F ) in Eq. (1).</p>
        <p>Our results for the <rs type="class">La1111 series</rs> demonstrate that <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is not directly affected by AF fluctuations as clearly seen from Figs. 2(a) and 2(c). Note that the oppo- site conclusion was derived for the <rs type="class">Na111 series</rs>, such as <rs type="material">NaFe 1−x Co x As</rs> 10 . In the <rs type="class">Na111 series</rs>, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> follows AF fluctuations when pressure is applied. At first sight, the results of the <rs type="class">Na111 series</rs> seem to contradict the results reported herein. One may classify the <rs type="class">La1111 series</rs> as an exotic and exceptional compound among <rs type="class">iron-based pnictides</rs>. However, all facts including the <rs type="class">La1111</rs> and <rs type="class">Na111 series</rs> are consistent if the superconductivity is not directly affected by antiferromagnetism or AF fluc- tuations. For all <rs type="class">iron-based pnictides</rs> without exception, 1/T 1 T becomes stronger as the doping level approaches the AF-phase boundary, but the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> optimal doping level is not always located on the AF-phase boundary and de- pends on the compounds, which causes an apparent dis- crepancy.</p>
        <p>Roughly speaking, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is proportional to the DOS and the paring interaction. The enhancement of the paring interaction is hardly expected for the AF-fluctuation- mediated scenario. As another candidate, the orbital- fluctuation-mediated scenario would be promising. In this case, orbital fluctuations are difficult to observe in 1/T 1 T at a doping level where the structural or nematic phase is absent, and thus the increase in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is observable via the DOS alone in 1/T 1 T . To investigate whether the paring interaction is enhanced simultaneously as well as the DOS, further theoretical investigations are needed; however, the results of (b) would give an impor- tant clue.</p>
        <p>One may consider another scenario where the pair- ing interaction originates from AF fluctuations, but AF fluctuations are suppressed at <rs type="pressure">ambient pressure</rs> by some competing interactions such as orbital and/or charge in- teractions. On the basis of this scenario, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> could be suppressed and the double-dome structure could be ob- served as observed in some high-T c <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>. Pressure could nullify the competition, and <rs type="tc">T c</rs> may increase un- der pressure even if AF fluctuations are not enhanced. However, the competing orders, which could cause ap- preciable suppression of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , have not been observed so far in a wide range around <rs type="material">x = 0.14 − 0.20</rs>. Furthermore, AF fluctuations tend to decrease by applying pressure as observed in the poorly F-doped regime or sufficiently H-doped regime [See Fig. 1(c)]. At present, there is no experimental evidence to support this scenario.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we have observed in <rs type="material">LaFeAsO 1−x H x</rs> that <rs type="tc">T c</rs> for <rs type="material" xml:id="x154">x = 0.20</rs> marks a high <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs corresp="#x154" type="tcValue">48 K</rs> upon ap- plying pressure without the influence of AF fluctuations. For <rs type="material">x = 0.44</rs> (near the second AF-phase boundary), <rs type="tc">T c</rs> remains unchanged without depending on the magnitude of AF fluctuations. These results suggest that the super- conductivity has no direct connection with AF fluctua- tions. So far as the results of 1/T 1 T are concerned, the increase in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> up to <rs type="tcValue">48 K</rs> originates from an enhancement of the DOS just above <rs type="tc">T c</rs>.</p>
