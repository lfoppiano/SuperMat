        <p>The predominantly d x 2 2y 2 pairing symmetry , the existence of spin fluctuations in the CuO 2 planes , and the pseudogap phenomena in the underdoped and optimally p-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> have been widely con- ceived as essential to high-temperature superconductivity. However, recent scanning tunneling spectroscopic studies have shown that the pairing symmetry may be dependent on the hole-doping concentration, with ͑d x 2 2y 2 1 s͒ mixed symmetries in certain overdoped <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> such as <rs type="material">͑Y 12x Ca x ͒Ba 2 Cu 3 O 72d</rs> . Furthermore, whether the pairing symmetry is d x 2 2y 2 or s wave in the one- layer n-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> such as <rs type="material">Nd 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 42d</rs> and <rs type="material">Pr 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 42d</rs> remains controversial , and it has been suggested that the pairing symmetry in the one-layer n-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> may change from d x 2 2y 2 to s, depending on the electron doping level . The nonuniversal pairing symmetries in <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductors imply that the sym- metry is likely the result of competing orders rather than a sufficient condition for pairing. Nonetheless, an important consequence of either d x 2 2y 2 or ͑d x 2 2y 2 1 s͒-wave pairing is that the resulting nodal quasiparticles can interact strongly with the quantum impurities in the CuO 2 planes , such that a small concentration of impurities can give rise to strong <rs type="tc">suppression of superconductivity</rs> and modification of the collective Cu 21 spin excitations . In addition, Kondo effects could be induced by nonmagnetic impurities through breaking the nearest- neighbor antiferromagnetic Cu 21 -Cu 21 interaction . Such strong response to nonmagnetic impurities is in sharp contrast to conventional s-wave superconductivity . Despite significant progress in the studies of <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductivity, the research on the simplest form of <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>, the infinite-layer system <rs type="material">Sr 12x L x CuO 2 (L La, Gd, Sm)</rs>, has been limited due to the difficulties in making single-phase samples with complete superconduct- ing volume. Recently, Jung et al. have demonstrated single-phase samples of <rs type="material" xml:id="x10">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> with nearly 100% superconducting volume and a sharp <rs type="tc">superconducting tran- sition temperature</rs> at <rs type="tc">T c</rs> <rs corresp="#x10" type="tcValue">43 K</rs>, thus enabling reliable spectroscopic studies of the pairing symmetry and the ef- fects of quantum impurities. These single-phased infinite- layer <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> are n-type with P4͞mmm symmetry, which differ significantly from other <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> in that no excess charge reservoir block exists between consecutive CuO 2 planes except a single layer of Sr(La), as illustrated in , suggesting stronger CuO 2 interplanar coupling. Furthermore, the c-axis superconducting coherence length ͑j c 0.53 nm͒ is found to be longer than the c-axis lattice constant ͑c 0 0.347 nm͒ , in stark contrast to other <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductors with j c ø c 0 . Hence, the super- conducting properties of the infinite-layer system are ex- pected to be more three-dimensional, as opposed to the quasi-two-dimensional nature of all other <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>. In this Letter, we report experimental findings based on the scan- ning tunneling spectroscopy studies of pure infinite-layer samples and those with a small concentration (1%) of ei- ther magnetic or nonmagnetic quantum impurities. A num- ber of surprising results are found and compared with the established phenomena in other <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>.</p>
        <p>The samples studied in this work included high- density granular materials of <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 (SLCO)</rs>, <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 ͑Cu 0.99 Zn 0.01 ͒O 2 (1% Zn-SLCO)</rs>, and <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 ͑Cu 0.99 Ni 0.01 ͒O 2 (1% Ni-SLCO)</rs> . X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the single-phase nature of all samples, and both XRD and scanning electron microscopy revealed random grain orientation and a typical grain size of a few micrometers in diameter. <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x17">Magnetization studies</rs> revealed nearly 100% superconducting volume for all samples, with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> <rs corresp="#x17,#x5-134,#x20" type="tcValue">43 K</rs> for <rs type="material" xml:id="x5-134">SLCO</rs> and <rs type="material" xml:id="x20">1% Zn-SLCO</rs>, and <rs type="tc">T c</rs> <rs corresp="#x17,#x23" type="tcValue">32 K</rs> for <rs type="material" xml:id="x23">1% Ni-SLCO</rs>.

(b) A representative surface topography of an area of <rs type="material">SLCO</rs> with subnanometer flatness. The typical area with atomic-scale flatness where most tunneling spectra were taken was greater than (20 nm 3 20 nm), and the work function of the spectra was 0.1 ϳ 1 eV.

        <p><rs type="tc">T c</rs> for up to 3% concentration, strong <rs type="tc">suppression of T c</rs> already occurred with <rs type="material">1% Ni</rs>, and nearly complete <rs type="tc">sup- pression of T c</rs> was reached with only <rs type="material">2% Ni</rs> . Thus, the global response of <rs type="material">SLCO</rs> to impurities appeared dif- ferent from that in the p-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> and was similar to that in conventional superconductors .</p>
        <p>Quasiparticle tunneling spectra were taken using a low- temperature scanning tunneling microscope on hundreds of randomly oriented grains for the three different infinite- layer samples, so that a range of different quasiparticle momenta relative to the crystalline axes of the local grains could be sampled. The sample surface was prepared ac- cording to the chemical etching method described else- where , and a nearly stoichiometric surface with no discernible chemical residue was confirmed with the x-ray photoemission spectroscopy . A typical surface topog- raphy of the <rs type="material">pure SLCO</rs> sample for our spectroscopic stud- ies with subnanometer flatness is exemplified in the left panel of , and a zoom-out view of this area is il- lustrated in . Confirming the local flatness for the tunneling spectra was to ensure that the average momen- tum of the incident quasiparticles relative to the crystalline axes of a grain was well defined. A set of representative differential conductance ͑dI͞dV ͒ vs biased voltage ͑V ͒ spectra for such a flat area is given in . In general, all spectral characteristics revealed long-range (.50 nm)</p>

        <p>spatial homogeneity within each grain and small variations in the superconducting gap value (D 13.0 6 1.0 meV) from one grain to another. Here ͑2D͞e͒ was defined as the conductance peak-to-peak separation in the spectra. This observation was in sharp contrast to our previous findings of strongly momentum-dependent spectra in the p-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> with d x 2 2y 2 pairing symmetry . The absence of the zero bias conductance peak (ZBCP) , known as a hallmark for unconventional pairing symmetry, for over 1000 spectra provided additional support for a fully gapped Fermi surface.</p>
        <p>Despite suggestive evidence for s-wave pairing symme- try, the unusually large ratio of ͑2D͞k B T c ͒ ഠ 7.0 as com- pared with the BCS ratio of 3.5 was indicative of strong coupling effects. Moreover, the commonly observed "sat- ellite features" in the quasiparticle spectra of p-type <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductors , as exemplified in the left in- set of , were invisible in <rs type="material">SLCO</rs>. The satellite fea- tures in p-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> were associated with quasiparticle damping by many-body interactions such as the collective spin excitations . Thus, the absence of satellite features in <rs type="material">SLCO</rs> is consistent with weakened spin fluc- tuations as the result of diluted antiferromagnetic coupling due to the presence of Cu 11 introduced by electron dop- ing. In addition, D was found to completely vanish above <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , with no apparent energy scale associated with any depression of the density of states (DOS) at T . <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , as shown in the right inset of , and the tunneling spectra were nearly temperature independent from just above <rs type="tc">T c</rs> to ϳ110 K. The absence of any spectroscopic pseudogap in the n-type infinite-layer system was dis- tinctly different from the findings in optimally doped and underdoped p-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> and was independently verified by the NMR studies on similar samples .</p>
        <p>By normalizing a typical spectrum in (a) relative to the background conductance shown in the left inset of , we compared the quasiparticle DOS of <rs type="material">SLCO</rs> with the BCS theoretical curve, as illustrated in . The spectral weight of <rs type="material">SLCO</rs> for quasiparticle energies at jEj $ D was smaller than the BCS prediction, whereas additional DOS appeared for jEj , D and the DOS ap- proached 0 at the Fermi level (i.e., V 0). Such behavior cannot be accounted for by the simple inclusion of disorder in the BCS weak-coupling limit, because the latter would have only broadened the width of the conductance peaks and also increased the DOS near V 0 substantially. The spectra also differed fundamentally from those of pure d x 2 2y 2 -wave <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> because of the lack of discernible gap variations and of the absence of ZBCP in all spectra taken on random grain orientations. Even in a special case of c-axis tunneling, jd 2 I͞dV 2 j V!0 would have been a positive constant in a d x 2 2y 2 -wave superconductor, as simulated by the thin solid line in , which is in contrast to the finding of jd 2 I͞dV 2 j V !0 6 0 in <rs type="material">SLCO</rs>. Interestingly, recent Knight shift data from NMR studies of similar <rs type="material">SLCO</rs> samples have revealed much smaller normal-state DOS at the Fermi level as compared with those of other <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> , which corroborates the inap- plicability of weak-coupling theory to <rs type="material">SLCO</rs>. We there- fore suggest strongly correlated s-wave pairing in the infinite-layer system based on the empirical findings of momentum-independent quasiparticle spectra, absence of ZBCP, and jd 2 I͞dV 2 j V !0 0 for all grain orientations.</p>
        <p>In the case of <rs type="material">1% Zn-SLCO</rs>, the spectral characteristics also revealed long-range spatial homogeneity in the spectra and a similar gap value (D 13.0 6 2.5 meV) for randomly sampled areas in different grains, as ex- emplified in the right inset of . Given that the average separation among Zn impurities is ϳ͑1.8 3 1.8 3 1.6͒ nm 3 , our exhaustive spectral studies should have covered a significant number of Zn impurities. However, no significant local variations were found in the spectra of the <rs type="material">1% Zn-SLCO</rs>, which differed fundamentally from our observation of atomic-scale spectral variations in a <rs type="material">YBa 2 ͑Cu 0.9934 Zn 0.0026 Mg 0.004 ͒ 3 O 6.9 single crystal</rs> near nonmagnetic Zn or Mg impurities using the same apparatus . Nevertheless, the conductance peaks in <rs type="material">1% Zn-SLCO</rs> were significantly broadened relative to <rs type="material">pure SLCO</rs>, with an increase in the DOS for jEj , D, as shown in the right inset of . These features suggest that Zn impu- rities resulted in reduced quasiparticle lifetime while re- taining <rs type="tc">T c</rs>, similar to the response of conventional s-wave superconductors .</p>
        <p>In contrast, two types of spectra were observed in <rs type="material">1% Ni-SLCO</rs>, as illustrated in . The majority spec- tra (.90%) exhibited suppressed coherence peaks, large zero bias residual conductance, strong electron-hole spec- tral asymmetry, and gradual spatial evolution over a long range. In contrast, the minority spectra (,10%) exhib- ited sharp spectral peaks, small zero bias conductance, and varying electron-hole spectral asymmetry over a short range (,1 nm), as exemplified in the inset of for two representative minority spectra. The significant spec- tral asymmetry implied different phase shifts in the elec- tronlike and holelike quasiparticle states as the result of broken time-reversal symmetry , which may be re- sponsible for the global suppression of the superconducting phase coherence and thus a reduction in <rs type="tc">T c</rs>.</p>
        <p>Assuming homogeneous Ni-impurity distributions, the average Ni-Ni separation would be d Ni ϳ 1.8 nm in the ab plane and ϳ1.6 nm along the c axis in each grain. The impurity wave function with poor screening from the carriers would have extended over a coherence vol- ume ͑j 2 ab j c ͒ . Given the coherence lengths j ab ϳ 4.8 nm and j c ϳ 0.53 nm , ϳ30% volume probabil- ity in each grain could be considered as under significantly weaker impurity influence. In the limit of completely ran- dom grain orientation in <rs type="material">1% Ni-SLCO</rs>, the STM studies of the grain surfaces would have ϳ20% probability for finding surface regions with weak impurity influence and spatial extension over a short range (ϳ0.5 nm) along the c axis. This simple estimate is in reasonable agreement</p>
        <ab type="figureCaption">(a) Main panel: comparison of a normalized majority spectrum of <rs type="material">1% Ni-SLCO</rs> and that of pure <rs type="material">SLCO</rs> at 4.2 K. The normalization was made relative to the background conductance shown by the dashed line in part (c). Inset: two minority spectra with different electron-hole asymmetry. (b) Spectral difference of the majority spectra relative to that of the <rs type="material">pure SLCO</rs>. (c) A series of spectra taken on the same grain of <rs type="material">1% Ni-SLCO</rs> at ϳ3 nm apart. The conductance of all curves except the lowest one has been displaced up for clarity.</ab>
        <p>with our observation of ϳ10% minority spectra with short- range (,1 nm) spatial homogeneity. However, due to the lack of direct information for the Ni distribution on the sample surface, the true origin for two types of spectra in <rs type="material">1% Ni-SLCO</rs> remains uncertain. Considering the spectral difference between the major- ity spectrum of <rs type="material">1% Ni-SLCO</rs> and that of <rs type="material">pure SLCO</rs>, as shown in , we find that the spectral characteris- tics resemble the findings in Ref. and are representa- tive of the impurity-induced state. On the other hand, the slowly varying majority spectra of <rs type="material">1% Ni-SLCO</rs>, as shown in , were possibly the result of strong overlapping in the Ni-impurity wave functions and of weak screen- ing effects due to low carrier density in <rs type="material">SLCO</rs>, which differed markedly from the rapidly diminishing impurity effects away from an isolated Mn or Gd atom on the surface of Nb , and also from the strong atomic-scale spectral variations near Ni impurities in the p-type <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> <rs type="material">Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca͑Cu 12x Ni x ͒ 2 O 81x</rs>. The contrast in the spa- tial extension of the Ni-impurity effects may be attributed to the variation in the impurity coupling strength and range, and also to the degree of impurity screening by carri- ers. We suggest that the strongly interacting Ni impurities in <rs type="material">1% Ni-SLCO</rs> are analogous to a Kondo alloy, which cannot be explained by the Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory for magnetic impurities in <rs type="class">BCS superconductors</rs>.</p>
        <p>The parent materials of all p-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> are Mott insulators with strong on-site Coulomb repulsion . Thus, the formation of d x 2 2y 2 -wave pairing symmetry is energetically favorable in reducing the Coulomb repulsion while retaining the quasi-two-dimensionality. On the other hand, the strong three-dimensional coupling in the infinite- layer system could favor s-wave pairing symmetry by com- pensating the resulting increase in the Coulomb repulsion with a large gain in the condensation energy. Thus, the pairing symmetry of <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductors may be de- pendent on the specific structures and various competing energy scales. Similarly, the pseudogap phenomena may be due to competing orders and need not be universal for all <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>.</p>
        <p>A recent study of the angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on three different families of p-type <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> suggested that an abrupt change of the electron velocity in the 50 80 meV energy range was ubiquitous and might be associated with the longitudinal optical oxygen phonon modes in the CuO 2 planes . Such changes in ARPES approximately coincided with a "dip" feature in the quasiparticle tunneling spectra of some <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> . However, our tunneling spectra of <rs type="material">SLCO</rs> revealed a dip energy at ϳ20 meV, and that of <rs type="material">YBa 2 ͑Cu 0.9934 Zn 0.0026 Mg 0.004 ͒ 3 O 6.9</rs> at ϳ30 meV, much smaller than the energy ϳ50 meV for <rs type="material">pure YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.9</rs> . Thus, the only ubiquitous features among all <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> appear to be the strong electronic correlation and the background antiferromagnetism of Cu 21 ions in the CuO 2 planes.</p>
