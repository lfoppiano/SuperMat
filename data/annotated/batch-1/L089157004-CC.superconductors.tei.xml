        <p>The relationship between unconventional superconduc- tivity and quantum criticality is emerging as an im- portant issue in strongly correlated materials, includ- ing <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>, organics and <rs type="class">heavy-fermion intermetallics</rs> . In each of these, either Nature or an externally imposed parameter, such as pressure or chemical substi- tutions, tunes some magnetic order to a T = 0 transi- tion where quantum fluctuations introduce new excita- tions that control thermodynamic and transport proper- ties over a broad range of temperature-parameter phase space. A frequent, but controversial , assumption is that these same excitations may mediate Cooper pair- ing in the anisotropic superconductivity that appears in the vicinity of a quantum-critical point (QCP). In- deed, the effective potential generated by proximity to a quantum-critical spin-density wave also can lead to anisotropic superconductivity.</p>
        <p>Though the issue of quantum criticality and super- conductivity came to prominence in the context of the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> (see, eg ), there have been several recent ex- amples of this interplay in <rs type="class">heavy-fermion compounds</rs> . Like the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>, unconventional superconductivity in these <rs type="class">Ce-based heavy-fermion materials</rs> develops out of a distinctly non-Fermi-liquid normal state that evolves in proximity to a continuous T = 0 antiferromagnetic transition; but unlike the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>, this state can be ac- cessed cleanly by applied hydrostatic pressure and with- out introducing extrinsic disorder associated with chemi- cal substitutions. In addition to chemical inhomogeneity in the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>, a further 'complication' is the existence of a pseudogap state above <rs type="tc">T c</rs> for dopings less than opti- mal . Whether evolution of the pseudogap with dop- ing produces another QCP near the optimal <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> is an open question as is the origin of the pseu- dogap . Thus far, a pseudogap has not been detected in <rs type="class">canonical quantum-critical heavy-fermion systems</rs>, such as <rs type="material" xml:id="x11">CeIn 3</rs> or <rs type="material" xml:id="x12">CePd 2 Si 2</rs> under pressure, but this may not be too surprising. In these cases, <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> ap- pears only at very low temperatures, <rs corresp="#x11,#x12" type="tcValue">less than 0.4 K</rs>, and over a narrow window of pressures (≤ 0.8 GPa) centered around the pressure where T N extrapolates to zero. In analogy to the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>, we would expect a pseudogap in these <rs type="class">Ce compounds</rs> to exist only over a narrow temper- ature window, 0.1 − 0.2 K above <rs type="tc">T c</rs>, and in a fraction of the narrow pressure window, which certainly would make detection of a pseudogap difficult.</p>
        <p><rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> offers the possibility of making a connec- tion between other <rs type="class">Ce-based heavy-fermion materials</rs> and the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>. Bulk, unconventional superconduc- tivity is present in <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> at <rs type="pressure">atmospheric pressure</rs> and develops out of a heavy-fermion nor- mal state in which the <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> is approximately linear in temperature. Application of a magnetic field suffi- cient to quench superconductivity reveals a <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> diverging as −T ln T and associated low-temperature en- tropy consistent with its huge zero-field <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> jump at T c (∆C/γT c = 4.5). Together, these proper- ties suggest that <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> may be near an antiferromag- netic quantum-critical point at P = 0. Its isostructural, antiferromagnetic relative <rs type="material" xml:id="x23">CeRhIn 5</rs> becomes a pressure- induced unconventional superconductor near <rs corresp="#x26" type="pressure">1.6 GPa</rs>, with a <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x23" type="tcValue" xml:id="x26">2.1 K</rs> close to that of <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> at P = <rs type="pressure">0</rs> . This and other similarities between <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> at P = <rs type="pressure">0</rs> and <rs type="material">CeRhIn 5</rs> at P = <rs type="pressure">1.6 GPa</rs> reinforce specula- tion that the nearby antiferromagnetic QCP in <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> may be at an inaccessible slightly negative pres- sure. The 1.7% smaller cell volume of <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> compared to that of <rs type="material">CeRhIn 5</rs> is consistent with this view. We have studied the effect of pressure on the <rs type="me_method">electrical resistivity</rs> and superconductivity of <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> and find striking cor- relations between them that are reminiscent of <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> behaviors.</p>
        <p>Four-probe AC <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> measurements, with current flowing in the tetragonal basal plane, were made on a <rs type="material">single crystal of CeCoIn 5</rs> grown from excess In flux. Hy- drostatic pressures to 5 GPa were generated in a toroidal anvil cell in which a boron-epoxy gasket surrounds a teflon capsule filled with a glycerol-water mixture (3:2 volume ratio) that served as the pressure transmitting fluid. Pressure inside the capsule was determined at room temperature and at low temperatures from the pressure- dependent <rs type="me_method">electrical resistivity</rs> and <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs type="material">Pb</rs>, respectively . The width of <rs type="tc">superconducting transition</rs> of Pb did not exceed 15 mK, indicating good hydrostatic conditions and providing an estimate of the pressure-measurement uncertainty, ±0.04 GPa.</p>

        <p>fermion compounds and reflects a systematic increase in the energy scale of spin fluctuations. Most interesting is the low-temperature response (where <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and the <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> just above <rs type="tc">T c</rs> (ρ(T + c ) decrease rapidly with pressures P &gt; 1.35 GPa. We have analyzed the low tem- perature <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs>, plotted over a broader temperature scale in the inset of , by either fitting to a form ρ(T ) = ρ 0 + AT n , with ρ 0 , A and n fitting parameters, or from plots of (ρ(T ) − ρ 0 )/T n . A drawback to the for- mer approach is that parameters can be sensitive to the temperature range chosen for fitting. The more sensitive and revealing approach is the latter in which ρ 0 and n are adjusted to give the best horizontal line. This procedure requires one less parameter, A, which is provided directly by the magnitude of (ρ(T ) − ρ 0 )/T n . Representative ex- amples of this approach are plotted in . Parameters obtained from these plots are well defined and agree, typ- ically to 10% or better, with parameter values extracted from straightforward fits. As indicated by arrows on the lowest pressure curve in , (ρ(T ) − ρ 0 )/T n deviates from the horizontal trend at a temperature T pg well above the <rs type="tc">onset of superconductivity</rs>. This departure implies either a decrease in the scattering rate or increase in car- rier density. Resistivity measurements at P = 0 and in a magnetic field (6 T) greater than H c2 (0) find a sim- ilar departure of (ρ(T ) − ρ 0 )/T n from a T -independent curve at T pg =3 K. Thus, T pg does not originate from su- perconducting fluctuations or from trace amounts of free indium. We also note that this behavior was present in previous measurements on other <rs type="material">single crystals CeCoIn 5</rs> but was missed in inspections of ρ versus T curves . We will return to a discussion of T pg later.</p>
        <p>Values of ρ 0 , n and A obtained from these plots are summarized in and b. There is an unmis- takable crossover in the pressure dependence of ρ 0 and</p>
        <ab type="figureCaption">Representative plots of (ρ(T ) − ρ0)/T n vs T . At low pressures, (ρ(T ) − ρ0)/T n is constant from Tpg ≈ (1.15 ± 0.05)Tc to about 10 K. At the higher pressures, there is a well-defined range below TF The resistive <rs type="tc">onset of superconductivity</rs>, defined by the intersection of linear extrapolations of ρ(T ) from above and below <rs type="tc">Tc</rs>, is denoted by dashed vertical arrows. At the highest pressures, the gradual rounding just above <rs type="tc">Tc</rs> is due to a broadened transition (see ) and not to Tpg</ab>
        <p>n at P * ≈ 1.6 GPa. Below P * , n = 1.0 ± 0.1 for T pg ≤ T ≤ 10 K. This value of n is expected for a 2- dimensional, antiferromagnetic quantum-critical system and is not too surprising given the layered crys- tal structure and anisotropy in electronic states of CeCoIn 5 . At pressures greater than P * , n rapidly approaches the Fermi-liquid value of 2.0, which holds from just above <rs type="tc">T c</rs> to T F L (see ). Though not shown in either or 3a, at these higher pressures n assumes a value of 1.5±0.1, characteristic of a 3-D antifer- romagnetic QCP, in a temperature interval from slightly greater than T F L to as high as ∼ 60 K. For P ≥ P * , ρ 0 decreases reversibly by an order of magnitude to a very small value of about 0.2 µΩcm. Clearly, pressure does not remove impurities from the sample; the large decrease in ρ 0 must be due to a pressure-induced change in inelas- tic scattering processes. Theories of electronic transport in quantum-critical systems show that impurity scattering can be strongly enhanced by quantum-critical fluctuations. This sensitivity provides a natural expla- nation for a decrease in scattering with increasing pres- sure, if there is a crossover near P * from quantum-critical (P &lt; P * ) to a Fermi-liquid-like state for (P &gt; P * ). Such a crossover is suggested by the pressure variation of n.</p>
        <p>Experimental values of the T n -coefficient of <rs type="me_method">resistiv- ity</rs>, plotted in , also decrease strongly with in- creasing pressure for P &lt; ∼ P * . For comparison, we show</p>

Though a T 2 coefficient proportional to γ 2 is expected for a Landau Fermi-liquid , it is not obvious a priori why A(P ) ap- proximately tracks the directly measured γ at low pres- sures, but this seems to be the case. In any event, both A(P ) and γ(P ) exhibit qualitatively different magnitudes and functional dependencies above and below P * . The dramatic differences in γ(P ) at low and high pressures suggest that either the empirical relationship is invalid and underestimates γ in the high-pressure regime by at least two orders of magnitude or there is a very rapid crossover in the density of low-energy excitations in the vicinity of P * . In the Fermi-liquid-like state above P * , we would expect the temperature scale T F L (see</p>

        <p>to be proportional to A −0.5 instead of the approximate T F L ∝ √ A found experimentally. We do not understand this discrepancy. Direct measurements of C/T at pres- sures above P * would be valuable.</p>
        <p>Finally, we note that the resistive transition to the su- perconducting state is equally sensitive to the crossover at P * . As shown in , the relative transition width ∆T c /T c passes through a pronounced minimum near P * . To some extent this behavior is accentuated by the pres- sure variation of <rs type="tc">T c</rs>, but ∆T c itself is a minimum near P * . It is as if the optimally homogeneous state is singular in the vicinity of P * .</p>
        <p>From the data presented above, we construct a temperature-pressure phase diagram for <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> given in . This phase diagram is more like that of the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> around optimal doping than the canonical behavior of heavy-fermion systems exemplified, for ex- ample, by <rs type="material">CeIn 3</rs> or <rs type="material">CePd 2 Si 2</rs> . There is no obvious long-range ordered state in <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> at atmospheric or higher pressures. Rather, in view of its relationship to <rs type="material">CeRhIn 5</rs> , a reasonable speculation is that the antiferro- magnetic QCP of <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> is at a slightly negative pres- sure. The <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> exponent n and <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> (ref. ) are those of a non-Fermi-liquid up to P * where <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is a maximum. Beyond P * , <rs type="tc">T c</rs> drops rapidly and param- eters characterizing electronic transport are qualitatively different, Fermi-liquid-like at temperatures just above <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and those of a 3-D quantum-critical antiferromagnetic state at higher temperatures.</p>
        <p>The generic T −P phase diagram in provides a broader perspective of our experimental observations and their relationship to <rs type="material">CeRhIn 5</rs> . In the spirit of this diagram, the non-Fermi-liquid transport and thermody- namic properties of <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> below P * are controlled by an antiferromagnetic QCP at the inaccessible nega- tive pressure denoted by P c in . We have chosen P c to correspond approximately to the critical pressure at which superconductivity appears in <rs type="material">CeRhIn 5</rs> . Spin- lattice relaxation measurements on <rs type="material">CeRhIn 5</rs> identify [28] a pseudogap whose signature first appears at pressures slightly less than P c and at a temperature of ∼5 K and then decreases toward <rs type="tc">T c</rs> with increasing pressure until its signature is lost at P &gt; ∼ P c . If we associate the tem- perature T pg (P ) in with a resistive signature for a pseudogap and extrapolate T pg (P ) in <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> to slightly negative pressures, there is a natural connection between our observations and properties of <rs type="material">CeRhIn 5</rs> . Neither the 1/T 1 T measurements on <rs type="material">CeRhIn 5</rs> nor our transport measurements on <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> permits definitive statements about the origin or nature of the pseudogap . We note, however, that 4-fold anisotropy of the thermal con- ductivity in the basal plane of <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> persists [12] to 3.2 K ≈ T pg at atmospheric pressure. If this in-plane modulation of the normal-state thermal conductivity is due to the presence of a pseudogap, it implies d-wave symmetry.</p>
        <p>The schematic phase diagram, , reflects the rela- tionship among various phases of <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> and <rs type="material">CeRhIn 5</rs> and is similar to the T -doping phase diagram of the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>. This diagram and experimental data from which it is inferred indicate that the physics of heavy- fermion systems may be more closely related to that of the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> than previously appreciated. Aside from the structural layering in <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> and <rs type="material">CeRhIn 5</rs> and their relatively high <rs type="tc">T c</rs>'s, they are similar in many respects to other <rs type="class">Ce-based heavy-fermion materials</rs> in which <rs type="tc">su- perconductivity develops</rs> near a QCP. Further study of <rs type="material">CeCoIn 5</rs> , in parallel with the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> and other <rs type="class">pressure-induced heavy-fermion superconductors</rs>, holds promise for bridging our understanding of the inter- relationship between unconventional superconductivity and quantum criticality across these interesting classes of correlated matter.</p>
