		<p>Evidence of Inhomogeneous Superconductivity in <material>FeTe 1-x Se x Thin Film</material> Using Scotch-Tape Method</p>
		<p>We have fabricated <material>thin films of FeTe 1-x Se x</material> using a scotch-tape method. The superconductivities of the thin films are different from each other although these films were fabricated from the same bulk sample. The result clearly presents the inhomogeneous superconductivity in <material>FeTe 1-x Se x</material>. The difference comes from inhomogeneity due to the excess Fe concentration. The <me_method>resistivity</me_method> of a thin film with low excess Fe shows good superconductivity with the sharp <tc>superconducting-transition</tc> width and more isotropic superconductivity.</p>
		<p><class>Fe-based superconductors</class> discovered in 2008 have stimulated fundamental discussion on the mechanism of superconductivity. Among the <class>Fe-based superconductors</class>, <class>11 type</class> compounds have the simplest structure consisting only of superconducting layers. On the other hand, the other <class>Fe-based superconductors</class> (<class>111 type</class>, <class>122 type</class>, <class>1111 type</class>, and so on) have a stacking structure with both superconducting layers and block layers. Thus, <class>11 type</class> superconductors have been extensively studied in order to understand the mechanism of Fe-based superconductivity. The <class>11 type</class> superconductor <material id="3-100">FeSe</material> <tc>exhibits superconductivity</tc> with <tc>T c</tc> = <tcValue ptr="#3-100">13K</tcValue> and its <tc>T c</tc> reaches <tcValue id="3-113" ptr="#3-100">37K</tcValue> under <pressure ptr="#3-113">high pressure</pressure> . The pressure dependence of <tc>T c</tc> relates to the anion height from the Fe layers , and <tc>T c</tc> of <material>FeSe</material> increases with decreasing anion (Se) height by <pressure>high pressure</pressure>. Thus, <class>11 type</class> superconductors have the potential of achieving a high <tc>T c</tc> . Additionally, <tc>T c</tc> of <material id="24">K 0.8 Fe 2 Se 2</material>, composed of K intercalation between FeSe layers, also shows an abrupt increase <tcValue ptr="#24">above 30 K</tcValue> .</p>
		<p>For <material id="26">(LiNH 2 ) x Fe 2 Se 2</material> , the superconductivity exhibits a <tc>higher T c</tc> of <tcValue ptr="#26">43 K</tcValue> . With an increase in the c lattice parameter and the separation between Fe-chalcogen layers, <tc>T c</tc> increases. Therefore, a change of Fe-chalcogen layer has a great impact on superconductivity. Recently, it was reported that a <material id="30">FeSe monolayer synthesized by MBE method</material> shows <tc>superconductivity</tc> at <tcValue ptr="#30">53 K</tcValue> . -GGA (spin-dependent generalized gradient approximation) calculations have predicted that a Dirac-cone state appears in a FeSe monolayer . The Dirac-cone states behind the superconducting state may substantially raise its <tc>T c</tc> . Furthermore, there are several reports where the <tc>T c</tc> of superconducting ultrathin films become higher than that of the bulk . Thus, an ultrathin film of <class>11 type</class> compounds may show an abrupt increase in <tc>T c</tc>.</p>
		<p>Recently, it was reported that thin films of the <class>11 type</class> superconductor <material>FeTe 1-x S x</material> can be fabricated by the scotch-tape method , which is a powerful technique to easily prepare an ultrathin film such as graphene . The structure of <class>11 type</class> compounds is similar to that of graphite since each layer is connected by van-der-Waals forces. In addition, <class>11 type</class> superconductors have no insulating block layer. Thus, the <class>11 type</class> superconductors are ideal candidates for the fabrication of a superconducting monolayer film by the scotch-tape method. If we could obtain a monolayer or ultrathin film, it will give us a greater understanding of the superconducting mechanism. Additionally, a property which has not been observed for the bulk yet may appear by the thinning. Thus, we fabricated the thin films and measured the <me_method>resistivities</me_method>.</p>
		<p>Single crystals of <material>FeTe 0.65 Se 0.35</material> were synthesized by a self-flux method. Powders of Fe (99.9%), Te (99.999%), and Se (99.9999%) were sealed into evacuated quartz tube with the desired molar ratio. Since the tube often cracks during the cooling, it was sealed into a larger evacuated tube. The doubly-sealed materials were heated at 1100 °C for 20 hours and then cooled about -2 °C /h down to 650 °C followed by furnace cooling. The obtained single crystal was placed on scotch tape, and cleaved several times. The scotch tape with the <material>FeTe 0.65 Se 0.35</material> flakes were attached to a silicon substrate with a silicon dioxide layer on the top surface, and pressed to enhance the bonding between the crystals and the substrate by van-der-Waals forces. By this process , thin single crystals were left on the substrate.</p>
		<p>An optical microscope and an atomic force microscope (AFM) were used to investigate the thin films fabricated by the scotch-tape method. We measured the <me_method>resistivity</me_method> of the thin films by four-terminal circuit fabricated using electron-beam lithography. In the process of electron-beam lithography, a resist was first spin-coated onto the substrates. The resist underwent a specially designed electron-beam scan routine in order to write electrode patterns. The irradiated area was removed by a developer, and then the electrode was deposited. The residual resist was finally taken off. By this technique, we prepared the four-terminal electrodes. The width and separation of the terminals are 2 and 3m, respectively.</p>
		<p>a)-(c) and (d)-(f) show optical microscopic and AFM images of <material id="43">FeTe 0.65 Se 0.35 thin films</material> fabricated by the scotch-tape method. From the height profile at the line indicated in Fig. 1(d)-(f), we observed that the surfaces of these films are flat, as shown in Figs. 1(g)-(i). These results indicate that a thin film with a flat surface can easily be obtained using the scotch-tape method. The thicknesses of these films were estimated to be 15, 65, and 100 nm, respectively. From the comparison between the optical and AFM images, we found that the colors of the thin films are gradually paled out with decreasing thicknesses. The temperature dependence of <me_method>resistivities</me_method> of these films with thicknesses of 15, 65, 100 nm, and the bulk are different from each other, as shown in Fig. 2. The same <tc>onset superconducting transition temperature</tc> <tc>T c</tc> on of <tcValue ptr="#43">15.0 K</tcValue> is observed for 65, 100 nm, and the bulk. However, the thin film with 15nm thickness does not show a <tc>superconducting transition</tc>. The transition widths (T c ) are T c = 4.6 K for 65 nm, T c = 1.0 K for 100 nm, and T c = 6.5 K for the bulk, respectively. The thin film with 100 nm thickness clearly shows a sharper <tc>superconducting transition</tc> than other films and the bulk. These results clearly show the inhomogeneous superconductivity in <material>FeTe 1-x Se x</material> although these films were extracted from the same bulk sample. Furthermore, the normal-state resistivities above <tc>T c</tc> show not only metallic properties but also semiconductivity. The normal-state resistivities for 65 and 100 nm slowly decreases with decreasing temperature while that for 15 nm and the bulk increases, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The broadening <tc>superconducting transition</tc> and the change from metallic to semiconducting behavior of each film are similar to the change of <material>Fe 1+d Te 1-x Se x</material> with increasing excess Fe composition [14,15]. Therefore, the increase of the resistivity corresponds to weak charge carrier localization due to the excess Fe, which results in the broadening of <tc>superconducting transition</tc> for 65 nm and the bulk. The existence of the excess Fe makes the crystal inhomogeneous. Thus, the result for 100 nm, which shows metallic <me_method>resistivity</me_method> with sharpest T c , suggests that a homogeneous crystal with low excess Fe, originally part of the bulk, is cleaved and remains on the surface of the substrate incidentally. This indicates that a homogeneous crystal with low excess Fe can be obtained using the scotch-tape method and shows ideal superconductivity. On the other hand, the result for 65nm implies that a part of the crystal with some excess Fe remains on the substrate and its superconductivity is inhibited by the excess Fe. For 15nm, a part of the crystal with a large excess of Fe remains and the superconductivity is completely suppressed and changes from metallic character to semiconductivity. Additionally, we determined the upper critical field H c2 (T) curves of the thin film with 100 nm thickness for H/c axis and the H/ab plane from the temperature dependence of the <me_method>resistivity</me_method> under a magnetic field. The temperature dependence of the <me_method>resistivity</me_method> under a magnetic field is summarized in Fig. 3 for (a) the H/c axis and (b) H/ab plane. The temperature at which the <me_method>resistivity</me_method> reached zero was systematically suppressed with increasing magnetic field. We estimated H c2 (T) from the criterion of 90% of normal-state resistivity. From the comparison of H c2 (T) for the thin film with bulk, H c2 (T) curves of the thin film shift toward higher field than those of bulk. Moreover, we calculated the H c2 ab (0) and H c2 c (0) using the data from 0 to 7T and Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory [16]: H c2 ab (0) = 134.3 T and H c2 c (0) = 90.6 T for the thin film, and H c2 ab (0) = 87.9 T and H c2 c (0) = 39.2 T for the bulk. We also estimated the irreversibility field from the criterion of 10% of normal-state resistivity, as shown in Fig 3(d): H irr ab (0) = 102.6 T and H irr c (0) = 45.6 T for the film, and H irr ab (0) = 53.9 T and H irr c (0) = 27.7 T for the bulk. The H irr for the film are much larger than that of the bulk and the previous reports . The anisotropy coefficients  determined from  = H c2 ab (0)/ H c2 c (0) were estimated to be 1.5 for the thin film and 2.2 for the bulk, respectively. The anisotropy coefficient  of the thin film shows more isotropic behavior than that of the bulk. We found that the film with the lowest T c exhibits more isotropic , high H c2 and H irr . In previous reports, the bulk sample with low excess Fe shows low T c than high excess Fe . Excess Fe induces the broadening T c , worse superconducting properties, and more anisotropic behavior than ideal <material>FeTe 1-x Se x</material> . Therefore, our results indicate that ideal <material>FeTe 1-x Se x</material> bulk should exhibit high superconducting performance with isotropic superconductivity and has an advantage to application.</p>
		<p>We have fabricated <material>thin films of FeTe 0.65 Se 0.35</material> using the scotch-tape method, and measured the <me_method>resistivities</me_method> of the thin films and the bulk sample. The different superconductivities in the thin films and the bulk were observed in spite of the films extracted from same bulk. The result clearly shows <material>FeTe 1-x Se x crystal</material> is inhomogeneous by location. The inhomogeneity comes from the excess Fe concentration by location. The <me_method>resistivity</me_method> of a thin film with low excess Fe shows that the excess Fe induces the lowest T c , high H c2 and H irr .</p>
