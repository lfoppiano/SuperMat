          <p>Magnetoresistance (MR) in the a-axis <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> of <rs type="material">untwinned YBa2Cu3Oy single crystals</rs> is mea- sured for a wide range of doping (<rs type="material">y = 6.45 − 7.0</rs>). The y-dependence of the in-plane coherence length ξ ab estimated from the fluctuation magnetoconductance indicates that the superconductivity is anomalously weakened in the 60-K phase; this gives evidence, together with the Hall coefficient and the a-axis thermopower data that suggest the hole doping to be 12% for y ≃ 6.65, that the origin of the 60-K plateau is the 1/8 anomaly. At high temperatures, the normal-state MR data show signatures of the Zeeman effect on the pseudogap in underdoped samples.</p>

      <p>Magnetoresistance (MR) is a useful tool to study the electron transport in metals, though its origin can be complicated. One can infer, for example, the significance of the spin-dependent mechanisms through the longitudi- nal MR, and the fluctuation magnetoconductivity (FMC) observed above <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of a superconductor can be used to estimate the coherence length. In high-T c <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>, the normal-state orbital MR is known to violate the Kohler's rule and to show an unusual temperature dependence, ∼ (aT 2 + b) −2 , which indicates that an unusual sit- uation for the charge transport, possibly a scattering- time separation , is realized. Also, it has been dis- cussed that a sizable FMC survives to much above <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> , even <rs type="tc">twice as high as T c</rs> in <rs type="material">optimally- doped La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO)</rs> . Such unusual MR behavior naturally calls for detailed doping-dependence studies of the MR to better understand the charge trans- port in <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>; however, there have been only a few reports on the hole-doping dependence of the MR behav- ior , and the key issues such as the evolution of the role of spins or the evolution of the fluctuation contributions are not really understood yet.</p>
      <p>In this Letter, we report the MR measurements of <rs type="material" xml:id="x8">un- twinned YBa 2 Cu 3 O y (YBCO) single crystals</rs> in a wide range of doping, from heavily underdoped (<rs type="tc">T c</rs> =<rs corresp="#x8" type="tcValue">20 K</rs>) to slightly overdoped regions. Since <rs type="material">YBCO</rs> contains Cu-O chains which can carry the electric current along the b- axis, we measure the magnetic-field dependence of the a-axis <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> ρ a and pay particular attention to sort- ing out the genuine MR behavior of the CuO 2 planes with a careful analysis involving also the b-axis <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> ρ b and the Hall resistivity ρ H . Based on the magnetocon- ductivity of the CuO 2 planes obtained after the analysis, we discuss both the normal-state magnetoconductivity at high temperatures and the FMC at lower temperatures. Most notably, the FMC is found to show a non-monotonic evolution with y and its y-dependence suggests that the superconductivity is anomalously weakened in the "60-K phase" of <rs type="material">YBCO</rs>; in combination with other in-plane <rs type="me_method">transport</rs> properties which suggest that the hole doping is actually 1/8 at <rs type="material">y ≃ 6.65</rs>, the present data give evidence for the 1/8-anomaly origin of the 60-K plateau.</p>
      <p>The <rs type="material">YBCO single crystals</rs> are grown in <rs type="material">Y 2 O 3</rs> crucibles by a conventional flux method , and are carefully de- twinned and annealed (see Ref. for details); the crys- tals reported here are in the range of <rs type="material">y = 6.45 − 7.0</rs> (the error in y is ±0.02). The MR measurements are done using an ac four-probe method under sweeping magnetic fields of ±10 T or ±14 T. Both the transverse (magnetic field H is perpendicular to the ab planes) and the longi- tudinal (H is parallel to the current I) MR are measured. The temperature is stabilized within ∼1 mK during the MR measurements by a home-build temperature regula- tion system employing both the Cernox resistance sensor and a capacitance sensor. Other details of the measure- ments of ρ a , ρ b , and ρ H are described in Ref. 7].</p>

        <p>Figure 1(a) shows the ρ a (T ) data for the series of our untwinned crystals. An unusual overlapping of the ρ a (T ) data for the "60-K phase" samples, which is clear in (a), has been discussed in Ref. . shows examples of the raw MR (∆ρ a ) data for y=7.0. All the data plotted in show the ordinary H 2 depen- dence, which becomes clear in the plot of ∆ρ a vs H 2 []. In the underdoped samples, however, we ob- served that the MR starts to become concave downward (or tends to saturate) in the ∆ρ a vs H 2 plot upon ap- proaching <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , as shown in (d) for <rs type="material" xml:id="x16">y=6.50</rs> (<rs type="tc">T c</rs> =<rs corresp="#x16" type="tcValue">35 K</rs>). Such H-dependence is most likely caused by a de- crease in the characteristic magnetic-field scale to sup- press superconducting fluctuations, and some vortex fluc- tuations in the pseudogap state are possibly in- volved in this anomaly. In any case, when this anomalous H-dependence is observed near <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , the MR data cannot be discussed on the same ground as those at higher tem- peratures, and therefore we do not include the MR data for temperatures very close to <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in the discussions after- wards. However, as long as the temperature is not very close to <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , the low-field part of ∆ρ a can reasonably be fitted with H 2 [as shown for the 50-K data in ] and for such data we determine the "magnitude" of MR from the low-field slope of the ∆ρ a vs H 2 plot. shows the summary of the transverse and lon- gitudinal MR ([∆ρ a /ρ a ] ⊥ and [∆ρ a /ρ a ] / , respectively) for the whole doping range. In , one may notice that the longitudinal MR rapidly diminishes with increas- ing temperature in highly-doped samples (<rs type="material">y=6.95 and 7.0</rs>), while it remains noticeable up to 270 K in the under- doped samples. While the low-temperature growth of the longitudinal MR is likely to originate from the Zeeman term in the FMC, its behavior in the high-temperature region is expected to reflect the properties of the normal-</p>

      <p>Since the longitudinal MR in <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> mostly mea- sures the Zeeman effect on the spin terms, the observed crossover in [∆ρ a /ρ a ] / near <rs type="material">y=6.8</rs> is likely to be a man- ifestation of the Zeeman effect on the pseudogap which opens in the normal state of underdoped samples. Re- member that the pseudogap is accompanied by a spin gap , which reduces the magnetic scattering rate; since the magnetic scatterings are recovered when the spin gap is suppressed by the Zeeman effect, a measurable longitu- dinal MR is actually expected in the pseudogap state.</p>
      <p>From the data of [∆ρ a /ρ a ] ⊥ and [∆ρ a /ρ a ] / , we can deduce the orbital magnetoconductivity of the CuO 2 planes, although the correct procedure is not simple for an anisotropic system. For an isotropic system, the MR (up to terms in B 2 ) is written as ∆ρ/ρ = −∆σ/σ − (σ xy /σ) , where σ is the conductivity and σ xy is the Hall conductivity . This formula can be generalized to an anisotropic system as ∆ρ a /ρ a = −∆σ a /σ a − σ 2 xy /(σ a σ b ); note here that in an anisotropic system σ xy and ρ H are related (up to terms in B) by σ xy = ρ H /(ρ a ρ b ) . There- fore, to obtain the correct magnetoconductivity from the MR data of an anisotropic system, one should use the formula ∆σ a /σ a = −∆ρ a /ρ a − ρ 2 H /(ρ a ρ b ). This means one needs to measure not only the a-axis transport but also ρ b and ρ H . To the best of our knowledge, this correct formula has never been used for the analyses of the mag- netoconductivity in <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>, even though ∆ρ a /ρ a and ρ 2 H /(ρ a ρ b ) can become the same order at high temper- atures. To obtain the orbital magnetoconductivity for our samples, we calculate both the transverse and the longitudinal magnetoconductivity by using the correct formula and take the difference. The data of ρ b and ρ H used in the analysis are shown elsewhere . show examples of the orbital magneto- conductivity data thus obtained. In the analysis of these data, we follow the recent trend to interpret</p>

The solid lines in Figs. 4(a)-(c) are the fits of the data to the normal-state contribution. The data at high tempera- tures are actually very well fitted with the (aT 2 + b) −2 dependence. The offset b is zero for y of down to 6.60, but becomes non-zero for smaller y, which corresponds well to the behavior of the ρ a (T ) data where a noticeable residual <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> becomes apparent for <rs type="me_method">y &lt; 6.60</rs> []; this seems to give additional support to the validity of this analysis. The y-dependence of the fitting param- eters are summarized in . We note that the magneto-resistance is not as well fitted with (aT 2 + b) −2 as the magneto-conductance, which implies the necessity of the correct calculation for ∆σ a /σ a . We can estimate the FMC by subtracting the normal-state contribution (determined from the high- temperature data) from the total magnetoconductivity. (a) depicts the evolution of the FMC in the (T − T c )/T c vs y plane using a color scale. It becomes clear in that, in addition to the general growth of the FMC with decreasing y, there is an enhancement in the FMC near <rs type="material">y=6.7</rs>, which corresponds to the 60-K phase of <rs type="material">YBCO</rs>; this means that the superconducting fluctuations are more easily suppressed with magnetic field and thus the characteristic field scale for <rs type="tc">supercon- ductivity</rs> is reduced near <rs type="material">y=6.7</rs>.</p>
      <p>This situation can be more quantitatively analyzed by fitting the FMC data to the Aslamazov-Larkin orbital (ALO) term ; the dashed lines in -(c) are the fits of the lower-temperature data to the normal-</p>

        <p>state contribution plus the ALO term. In determining the dashed lines, there are two fitting parameters, the in-plane and c-axis coherence lengths, ξ ab and ξ c . (<rs type="tc">T c</rs> is set to the zero-resistance <rs type="tc">T c</rs> .) Since the fits become in- sensitive to ξ c for y &lt; 6.9 where ξ c 1Å, for underdoped samples we fix ξ c to be near 1Å and only change ξ ab in the fits. Although not many data points are available for fitting for each composition, we can determine ξ ab with roughly 20% error from the ALO fits. (b) shows the y-dependence of ξ ab obtained from the ALO fits. The general trend is that ξ ab increases with decreasing hole doping, which is natural because the mean-field upper critical field at zero temperature,  ab )], is expected to be <rs type="tc">reduced as T c goes down</rs>. However, for <rs type="material">y ≃ 6.7</rs> there is a marked anomaly that ξ ab deviates upwardly from the general trend, which corresponds to a suppression of H MF c2 in the 60-K phase []. This is in accord with the trend already ap- parent in . We note that this implication on the upper critical field is actually corroborated by the behavior of the resistive transition in 16 T, where the 60-K-phase samples show a marked broadening compared to other compositions, as demonstrated in . There- fore, both ξ ab and the <rs type="tc">resistive transition</rs> appear to indi- cate that the <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> is anomalously weak to the applied magnetic field in the region near <rs type="material">y=6.7</rs>.</p>
      <p>It is worthwhile to note that the present data are useful for elucidating the origin of the 60-K plateau. Remem- ber that the 60-K plateau is just a plateau and is not a dip in <rs type="tc">T c</rs>, and there has been no clear evidence that the superconductivity is weakened in the plateau; it should therefore be recognized that our result for H c2 gives ev- idence that the superconductivity is actually weakened</p>
        <ab type="figureCaption">(a) ρa(T ) data for <rs type="tc">y=6.45, 6.70, and 7.00</rs> in zero- field (thin lines) and in 16 T (thick lines).

        <p>in the plateau. Since the weakening of the superconduc- tivity is the fundamental feature of the 1/8 anomaly in the <rs type="class">La-based cuprates</rs>, the present result clearly speaks for the 1/8-anomaly origin of the 60-K plateau. Fur- thermore, comparisons of the Hall coefficient R H and a- axis thermopower S a of 60-K <rs type="material">YBCO</rs> to those of <rs type="material">LSCO</rs> at <rs type="material">x=0.12</rs> strongly suggest that the hole doping is in fact 1/8 for <rs type="material">y ≃ 6.65</rs>; Figs. 6(b) and 6(c) show such comparisons in R H (T )e/V 0 (V 0 is the volume per Cu in the plane) and S a (T ), which demonstrate that <rs type="material">LSCO</rs> at <rs type="material">x=0.12</rs> and <rs type="material">YBCO</rs> at <rs type="material">y ≃ 6.65</rs> show quite similar val- ues near room temperature, and these parameters have been proposed to be good indicators of the hole doping in <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> . Therefore, it appears that in the 60-K plateau the hole doping is actually ∼1/8 and the super- conductivity is weakened, which together mean that the 60-K plateau is a manifestation of the 1/8 anomaly. It is useful to note that a reasonably good case for the connec- tion between the plateau and the 1/8 anomaly was made previously in a complementary way, using Ca doping . It should however be noted that static charge stripes (a sort of charge density wave that localizes the carriers) do not appear to be the fundamental "cause" of the weak- ening of the superconductivity in <rs type="material">YBCO</rs>, since there is no evidence for static stripes in <rs type="material">YBCO</rs>. It is of course possible that the impact of the stripes at the 1/8 doping varies depending on the level of dynamics of the stripes in various <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> systems. A more interesting possibil- ity is that a proximity to a quantum critical point (QCP) is the more fundamental cause of the 1/8 anomaly: Recently, Aeppli et al. reported that the magnetic response of the <rs type="material">Nd-free LSCO</rs> (where there is also no ev- idence for static charge stripes) bears a signature of the quantum criticality. In our data, fluctuations seem to be enhanced near <rs type="material">y=6.7</rs> while the <rs type="tc">superconductivity is sup- pressed</rs>, which might also be an indication of a proximity to a QCP; if so, this particular QCP <rs type="tc">suppresses super- conductivity</rs> through enhanced fluctuations, rather than creates superconductivity.</p>
      <p>Lastly, we note the implication of the overall evolution of ξ ab . In <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>, the pseudogap causes the energy gap ∆ to grow upon underdoping , and thus there is no proportionality between ∆ and <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . It is therefore not obvious whether ξ ab should follow the behavior of ∆ or that of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . This is a rather fundamental problem in the pseudogap physics , but experimental data have been lacking. The complicated y dependence of ξ ab indicates that neither ∆ nor <rs type="tc">T c</rs> are solely decisive and that an elaborate theory is necessary to describe ξ ab .</p>
