          <p><rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> hosts both topological surface states and <rs type="tc">bulk superconductivity</rs>. It has been identified recently as a topological superconductor (TSC) with an extraordinary nematic, i.e., C 2 -symmetric superconducting state and odd-parity pairing. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy, we directly examine the response of the superconductivity of <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> to magnetic field. Under out-of-plane fields (B ⊥ ), we discover elongated magnetic vortices hosting zero-bias conductance peaks consistent with the Majorana bound states expected in a TSC. Under in-plane fields (B == ), the average superconducting gap exhibits twofold symmetry with field orientation; the long C 2 symmetry axes are pinned to the dihedral mirror planes under B == ¼ 0.5 T but rotate slightly under B == ¼ 1.0 T. Moreover, a nodeless Δ 4x gap structure is semiquantitatively determined for the first time. Our data paint a microscopic picture of the nematic superconductivity in <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> and pose strong constraints on theory.</p>

        <p>Topological superconductors, as host of Majorana fer- mions and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) , may facili- tate topological quantum computing. However, in practice, topological superconductors (TSCs) are rare. Among the various recipes for making a TSC , bulk supercon- ductors that host topological surface states are the most natural candidates. However, unlike the theoretical triumph in predicting topological insulators , metals, and semimetals, theory and experiment diverge when it comes to TSCs. Consequently, there is a large gap in our understanding of TSCs, and in particular, details of the microscopic behavior of TSCs are in urgent demand for improving theory.</p>
        <p><rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> is a prototypical example of the difficulties encountered. Since it hosts both topologically nontrivial surface states and bulk superconductivity , it has been proposed to be a TSC, likely with an odd-parity pairing symmetry . However, experimental results on <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> present challenges for this interpretation. The absence of Pauli limiting behavior in the upper critical field suggests spin-triplet superconductivity or an anisotropic spin-singlet state , and point-contact spectroscopy found a zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP) on a cleaved surface , which was attributed to MZMs. However, Andreev reflection spectroscopy on <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> shows that the existence of the ZBCP depends on the barrier strength; its absence under finite barrier strength implies the absence of zero-energy Majorana fermions . Furthermore, a low-temperature STM study observed a full superconducting gap without in- gap states or any ZBCP in the vortex core, discrediting <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> as a TSC .</p>
        <p>Recently, a nematic superconducting state was discov- ered in a NMR study of <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> (Ref. ). The spin susceptibility in the superconducting state exhibits twofold symmetry when rotating the in-plane magnetic field, which is surprising considering the threefold symmetry of the lattice. This symmetry breaking, together with the invariance of the Knight shift upon crossing <rs type="tc">T c</rs> under an out-of-plane field, indicates the Cooper pairs are in a pseudo-spin-triplet state with a pinned d-vector direction . Subsequently, measurements on <rs type="material">Cu-, Sr-, and Nb-doped Bi 2 Se 3</rs> superconductors all revealed twofold symmetry in the in-plane field angular dependence of the <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs>, upper critical field, critical current, and magnetoresistance below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> (Refs. ). These remarkable observations in <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> have established it as an odd-parity TSC state , with the d vector pinned to a specific lattice axis by strong spin-orbit coupling. However, contradictions still exist, especially in the gap symmetry and the pinning directions of the d vectors among the reported bulk and/or macroscopic measurements . The d vector is reported to be pinned along the Se─Se bond direction in a NMR study by Matano et al. , but it lies along the dihedral mirror plane of the Se lattice in <rs type="me_method">specific heat measurements</rs> by Yonezawa et al. and magnetoresistance measurements by Pan et al. . Thus, to reach a comprehensive micro- scopic understanding of this unique state and to reconcile the previous contradicting reports, we investigate the super- conducting properties of <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> by STM at ultralow temperature under magnetic fields with variable direction.</p>
        <p>The <rs type="material" xml:id="x17">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3 (x ¼ 0.31) single crystals</rs> are prepared via an electrochemical intercalation method as described in Ref. . <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x18">Magnetic susceptibility measurement</rs> shows a <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs> (<rs type="tc">T c</rs> ) of about <rs corresp="#x17,#x18" type="tcValue">3 K</rs> and shielding fraction of about 17% at 1.8 K (see Part 1A of Ref. ). STM measurements are conducted in a milli- kelvin STM system with vector magnetic field at the base temperature of 20 mK. The effective electron temperature (T eff ) of the system is calibrated to be 310 mK (see Part 2 of Ref. ). The <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> samples are cleaved in vacuum at 77 K and immediately transferred into the STM module. PtIr STM tips are used after being treated on an Au (111) surface. The dI=dV spectra are collected using a standard lock-in technique with modulation frequency f ¼ 787 Hz and typical modulation amplitude ΔV ¼ 30-50 μV.</p>
        <p><rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3 crystals</rs> are thin-bar shaped with sizes of about 1.7 × 1.3 × 0.30 mm 3 for sample 1 and 2.5 × 1.7 × 0.14 mm 3 for sample 2. The demagnetization effect due to the irregular sample shape is very weak, as discussed in Part 1B of Ref. ; thus, it is neglected in our experiments under magnetic fields. For the measurements under B == , the possible residual out-of-plane field component is carefully eliminated via vortex mapping (see Part 3 of Ref. ). Moreover, the influence of the in-plane magnetic vortex and spatially inhomogeneity of superconducting gap under B == are considered and discussed in detail in Part 4 of Ref. .</p>
        <p>The cleaved <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> surface exhibits three types of regions , two superconducting (SC-I, SC-II) and one nonsuperconducting (NSC). The statistics on how often these regions are observed in different samples are summarized in of Ref. . The probability of SC regions being found is unexpectedly low, indicative of the intrinsically inhomogeneous superconductivity of <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> .</p>
        <p>show the surface morphology of the NSC region. Large, flat terraces are observed, whose heights are integer multiples of 0.95 nm, as shown in . This height corresponds to the spacing between adjacent Bi 2 Se 3 quintuple layers based on previous x-ray diffraction of <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> (Ref. ). The terraces are atomically flat with two kinds of intrinsic defects []. Bright dots are most likely intercalated Cu atoms as seen in previous STM studies , while trefoil defects, commonly observed on Bi 2 Se 3 surfaces, arise from the substitution of Se atoms by Bi (Ref. ). The inset of shows the undistorted hexagonal Se atomic lattice with the lattice constant of about 0.41 nm.</p>
        <p>Here we define the x axis as one of the Se─Se bond directions and the y axis as perpendicular to x within the same Se plane, as indicated in the inset of . As for the electronic structure, a Dirac-conelike feature is sug- gested by linearly dispersing density of states (DOS) observed in the dI=dV spectra shown in (d) , as well as the quasiparticle interference patterns along a step edge shown in Part 5 of Ref. . The extracted Dirac point is located at about 370 meV below the Fermi energy (E F ). This is consistent with angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on <rs type="material">bulk Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> crystals , indicating the existence of topologically nontrivial surface states in NSC regions. A nearly flat DOS is observed around E F [], precluding the existence of a superconducting gap.</p>
        <p>Figures 1(f) and 1(g) display the surface morphologies of one kind of superconducting region (SC-I) observed in sample 1. Large terraces are observed here as well, but their heights are integer multiples of 1.56 nm [], much larger than in the NSC regions. Moreover, as shown in , the terraces are rough, with many Cu clusters distributed on them. It appears that the spacing between Bi 2 Se 3 quintuple layers in this region is expanded consid- erably by Cu intercalation, which will lead to a more two- dimensional structure. The SC-I region is adjacent to the NSC region shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). Although the surface lattice cannot be directly seen in the SC-I region, the orientation of atomic step edges suggests it has the same lattice orientation with the nearby NSC region (see Part 1D of Ref. for details). The dI=dV spectrum obtained in the SC-I regions [] exhibits a similar Dirac- conelike feature, but the Dirac point is now 650 meV below E F . This significant shift to lower energy compared to the NSC region indicates that the SC-I region is heavily doped with electrons. As shown in , a fully developed superconducting gap with pronounced coherence peaks is observed at E F , which is consistent with previous reports . We note that the heavy-electron-doping effect may be critical for the origin of superconductivity here. Such a U-shaped gap is spatially homogeneous in the SC-I region, and it is insensitive to Cu clusters and step edges,as shown in (k) and in Ref. . Usually for spin-triplet superconductors, such as <rs type="material">Sr 2 RuO 4</rs> , the super- conductivity is very sensitive to impurities . However, two theoretical studies suggest a different impurity- scattering behavior for the unconventional superconduc- tivity resided in a topological insulator, where the pair decoherence introduced by impurity scattering is strongly suppressed by spin-orbital coupling and spin helical nature in <rs type="class">intercalated Bi 2 Se 3</rs>.</p>
        <p>In addition to the SC-I regions, we observe another type of superconducting region (referred to here as SC-II) in sample 2, on islands with steep topographic variations as shown in Figs. 1(l) and 1(m). While the NSC and SC-I regions often exhibit large flat terraces with uniform terrace height, the SC-II regions exhibit many irregular terraces of several to tens of nanometers width; the terrace height is nonuniform, even with fractional values observed, whose origins are discussed in Part 1E of Ref. . However, the terraces are atomically flat with the atomic lattice shown in the inset of , which is the same as that of the NSC region. No clear Dirac-conelike feature is observed in this region, while a sharp U-shaped superconducting gap</p>

        <p>appears at E F , as shown in Figs. 1(o) and 1(n), respectively. Why superconductivity occurs in these islands is unclear, and we provide a discussion in Part 1E of Ref. .</p>
        <p>The U-shaped spectrum suggests the superconducting gap is fully opened at the Fermi surface; however, we find that it still has significant broadening beyond thermal effects, which can be reasonably accounted for by k-space anisotropy of the gap size . We fitted the super- conducting spectra by the Dynes formula with a twofold anisotropic gap function: Δ k ¼ Δ 0 þ Δ 1 j cos θj and T eff ¼ 310 mK (see Part 6 of Ref. ). A small Dynes term Γ is used to account for finite quasiparticle lifetime broad- ening . The fit to the gap in the SC-I region shown in (h) yields Δ 0 ¼ 0.256 meV, Δ 1 ¼ 0.206 meV, and Γ ¼ 0.004 meV; the fit to a typical superconducting spec- trum in the SC-II region [Evidently, these regions differ greatly in gap size and gap anisotropy ratio. Significant anisotropy of the superconducting gap is expected for the reported nematic superconducting state of <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> (Refs. ).</p>
        <p>To further examine the superconducting state, we apply an out-of-plane magnetic field and measure the SC-I regions. (a) and in Ref. show zero- bias conductance (ZBC) mappings under various B ⊥ , where typical vortex lattices are revealed. It is notable that the vortices are significantly elongated along the y axis and exhibit an elliptical shape. Meanwhile, the vortex lattices are also stretched along this direction. Exponential fits to the profiles along the long and short axes of a vortex under B ⊥ ¼ 0.2 T are shown in , which give Ginzburg-Landau coherence lengths (ξ) of 30.83 and 19.70 nm, respectively, a ratio of 1∶0.64. Since the shape of the vortex is related to the superconducting gap structure , the elongated vortices observed here are consistent with the highly anisotropic superconducting gap (Δ k ) suggested by the fit in , where the ratio between the gap maximum and gap minimum in the SC-I region is estimated to be ðΔ 0 þ Δ 1 Þ∶Δ 0 ¼ 1∶0.55. Moreover, upon increasing B ⊥ , as the vortex density increases, the vortex size and ξ decrease noticeably [(c) and Figs. S9(a)-S9(c) in Ref. ). Such a significant field dependence of the vortex</p>

(f) dI=dV spectra as a function of field strength, comparing the vortex core center (red curve) with the bulk tens of nanometers away.</ab>
        <p>size may suggest multiband effects ; e.g., the ξ of the surface and bulk states of <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> could be different. We note that a field-dependent coherence length was also observed in <rs type="material">Bi 2 Te 3 films grown on a NbSe 2 substrate</rs> .</p>
        <p>Figures 2(d) and 2(e) show the evolution of dI=dV spectra taken along the short and long axes, respectively, of a vortex under B ⊥ ¼ 0.2 T. Far from the vortex, the superconducting gap is only slightly affected [blue curves in Figs. 2(d) and 2(e)], and it is gradually suppressed upon approaching the vortex core. Within a few nanometers of one vortex core center, weak ZBCPs are observed with a full width at half maximum of about 0.29 meV [red curves in Figs. 2(d) and 2(e)]. This ZBCP is observed for the first time in vortices of <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> (Refs. ). It could be composed of both conventional Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon bound states and the long-predicted Majorana bound state expected at zero energy in 2D TSC. These are hard to distinguish because the energy separation of the bound states δE ¼ Δ 2 =E F (Ref. ) is about 0.4 μeV here, assuming Δ k ¼ 0.5 meV and E F ¼ 650 meV. Nevertheless, our observation of a ZBCP is consistent with the prediction of TSC in <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> . As shown in (f) and Figs. S9(d), S9(e), and S10 in Ref. , ZBCPs have also been observed in some vortex cores under B ⊥ ¼ 0.3 T, but their intensities are slightly weaker than under B ⊥ ¼ 0.2 T. The spectrum near zero bias is distorted for B ⊥ ¼ 0.4 T, and the ZBCP is clearly absent for B ⊥ ¼ 0.6 T, as shown in and in Ref. . This behavior resembles the evolution of the Majorana zero-energy mode observed in 5-QL <rs type="material">Bi 2 Te 3 films grown on NbSe 2</rs> (Ref. ). The weakening and disappearance of a ZBCP in the vortex core under high field is interpreted as a result of the coupling between states in adjacent vortices . When the field is small, the distance between vortices is large compared to the vortex core size, so the interaction between the vortex bound states can be neglected. Upon increasing field, the intervortex distance shortens, enhancing these interactions and even- tually destroying the Majorana zero mode .</p>
        <p>To further illustrate the nematic superconductivity in <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs>, we apply an in-plane magnetic field and study the superconducting spectra within the same area of the SC-I region as a function of θ defined as the azimuthal angle of B == with respect to the x axis of the Se lattice [see inset of ]. Under various B == , no obvious in-plane vortices are observed on the surface, and the superconduct- ing spectra are spatially homogeneous (see Part 4 of Ref. for more details). This phenomenon is possible because the superconductivity on the surface (likely resides in topological surface state) is more robust to the orbital depairing of an in-plane field so that the bulk vortex lines are pushed away from the surface, as shown theoretically in Ref. . Consequently, the in-plane field does not gen- erate noticeable spatial inhomogeneity on the supercon- ducting spectrum. However, we observe obvious variation of the superconducting spectrum with the direction of B == .</p>

        <p>(a) shows typical superconducting spectra when applying a B == of 0.5 T at θ ¼ 90°, 40°, and 10°. Clearly, the superconducting gap, as estimated from both the leading edge (Δ Ã LE ) and coherence peaks (Δ Ã CP ), varies with θ. We use asterisks (*) here to emphasize that these actually constitute weighted averages of Δ k under B == . The angular dependence of Δ Ã CP and Δ Ã LE based on an extensive data set is summarized in and exhibits clear twofold symmetry, with maxima around θ ¼ 90°and 270°(coincid- ing with the y axis) and minima near θ ¼ 0°and 180°( coinciding with the x axis). show similar twofold symmetry for B == ¼ 1.0 T. In addition, Δ Ã LE along θ ¼ 85°, 40°, and 0°decrease monotonically with increasing B == , and no crossover is observed between them, as shown in and in Ref. . Our detailed experiments indicate that the superconducting gap (Δ Ã CP and Δ Ã LE ) of <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> exhibits twofold symmetry throughout the studied B == range from 0.25 to 1.5 T. The suppression of the superconducting gap by B == is much faster along the x axis (θ ¼ 0°) than nearly along the y axis (θ ¼ 85°), suggesting a smaller upper critical field B c2 along the x axis. Thus, a larger ξ y is evaluated than ξ x from the Ginzburg-Landau relations B x c2 ¼ ½ðΦ 0 Þ=ð2πξ c ξ y Þ and B y c2 ¼ ½ðΦ 0 Þ=ð2πξ c ξ x Þ, which is consistent with our obser- vations that the vortex is elongated along the y axis of the lattice shown in . (f) displays the oscil- lation amplitudes of Δ Ã CP and Δ Ã LE under various B == . The ratios are different for Δ Ã CP and Δ Ã LE , but the trend is the same-both increase gradually as B == increases. For Δ Ã LE , the oscillation amplitude increases from 8.7% under B == ¼ 0.25 T to 28.9% under B == ¼ 1.5 T, while for Δ Ã CP it changes from 5.1% to 8.1%. The gradual smearing of the gap edge (Δ Ã LE ) of the DOS under B == is consistent with the Volovik effect; the quasiparticle energy spectrum is Doppler shifted in the mixed state due to a supercurrent flow running around the vortices, which leads to a broad- ening of the gap edge even for a nodeless superconductor at finite temperature .</p>

        <p>orbital depairing effect of B == (in-plane vortex) is not obvious here, the influence of B == on superconductivity mainly includes two effects: the Volovik and Zeeman effects. The former effect has been extensively studied in nodal superconductors theoretically and exper- imentally and leads to a DOS under B == that exhibits characteristic oscillatory behavior with field ori- entation. At low temperature and low field, as illustrated in , more quasiparticles are excited when the field is perpendicular to the gap minimal direction of Δ k than along other directions because the field-induced supercurrents (which run perpendicular to the field) can lead to the strongest Doppler shift of the quasiparticle energy around the gap minimal region. Thus, the short axis of Δ Ã LE is actually perpendicular to the gap minimal direction, since this field orientation produces the most quasiparticle excitations. Meanwhile, the application of B == will induce Zeeman effect, whose energy scale is about 0.1 meV for B == ¼ 1.0 T, comparable to the minimal gap magnitude (0.256 meV) in the SC-I region. For E u -symmetry pairing, the d vector is expected to be parallel to the maximal gap direction of Δ k , and it is normal to the plane in which the spins of the equal-spin-paired electrons are aligned . The Zeeman depairing effect is the strongest when B == is parallel to the d vector because the electron spins may deviate from the original plane under sufficient B == . Therefore, both the Volovik effect and Zeeman effect will suppress Δ Ã LE much more strongly when B == lies along the maximal gap direction of Δ k . Consequently, the distribu- tion of Δ k for the SC-I region can be qualitatively determined; as illustrated by the thick blue curve in , the gap maxima are along a Se─Se bond direction, which is rotated 90°from the long axis of Δ Ã LE . The tunneling spectra here and the <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> measured by Yonezawa et al. reflect the integrated DOS over the Fermi surface under the influence of B == , and they thus exhibit weaker anisotropy than Δ k , whose anisotropy can be more precisely estimated by fitting the tunneling spectra or via the vortex anisotropy. The blue curve thus gives the first semiquanti- tative sketch of an anisotropic nodeless gap structure in <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs>. This angular distribution of the Δ k is consistent with the orientation of the observed elongated vortices as, empirically, a vortex will extend out in the direction of a gap minimum (assuming only weak Fermi velocity anisotropy) .</p>
        <p>For the SC-II region, qualitatively similar data are measured on two domains (see Figs. S12 and S13 in Ref. ). Δ Ã LE and Δ Ã CP in this region also vary noticeably with field orientation θ, exhibiting twofold symmetry, although the Δ k here are larger than those of the SC-I regions. gives the angular dependence of Δ Ã LE in domain A of the SC-II region under B == ¼ 0.5 T; the long axis of Δ Ã LE lies along the dihedral mirror plane of the Se lattice. According to above analysis, the angular distribution of Δ k in domain A is illustrated by the blue curve, with its maxima again along a Se─Se bond direction. Similar to the case of the SC-I region, in domain B of the SC-II region, which has the same lattice orientation as domain A, the long axis of Δ Ã LE under B == ¼ 1.0 T is rotated to an intermediate angle, about 20.7°off another dihedral mirror plane, as shown in and in Ref. . The origin of such a rotation under B == ¼ 1.0 T is unclear and merits future investigation. Our data show that gap nematicity is ubiquitous in all the super- conducting domains of <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs>, the long C 2 axis of Δ k is pinned along one of the three equivalent Se─Se bond directions, which may vary for different SC domains (see more discussion in Part 9 of Ref. ).</p>
        <p>In the theory of Fu describing the nematic super- conductivity in <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> , two types of odd-parity pairing symmetries were proposed, Δ 4y and Δ 4x . Δ 4y is nodeless with its gap maxima along a dihedral mirror plane of the Se lattice (y axis), while Δ 4x has its gap maxima along a Se─Se bond direction (x axis) with a pair of point nodes in the y-z plane that are protected by mirror symmetry. The Δ 4y gap distribution is supported by <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> and magnetoresistance measurements . However, our data suggest that the gap maxima of Δ k are pinned along one of the three equivalent Se─Se bond directions, consistent with the NMR study and supporting a Δ 4x pairing sym- metry without nodes. The differences among bulk mea- surements remind us that the summed responses from all domains with different gap amplitudes and orientations may give an average gap maximum rotated from the actual ones, as the multidomain effect is directly observed in our study of the SC-II region (Part 9 of Ref. ) and previously discussed by Yonezawa et al. in of their paper . Thus, our findings at the atomic scale facilitate an understanding of the complex phenomena reported in bulk measurements on <rs type="class">doped Bi 2 Se 3</rs> materials and provide more-direct constraints on theory.</p>
        <p>In summary, our data reveal a unique nematic super- conducting state in <rs type="material">Cu x Bi 2 Se 3</rs> and give a semiquantitative description of its anisotropic gap distribution, which is likely a nodeless Δ 4x pairing symmetry. On the one hand, we observe a Dirac-conelike surface DOS in the SC-I regions, a ZBCP in vortex cores under 0.2-0.3 T out-of- plane fields, and a nematic superconducting order param- eter with an anisotropic gap and a preferential symmetry axis. A nematic superconducting state with an anisotropic gap has been predicted only for odd-parity superconduc- tivity , and the preferential direction of the C 2 symmetry axis of the gap and its highly nontrivial response to field strength indeed suggest a pseudospin triplet pairing . The ZBCP might be the long-sought Majorana bound state, so our findings further support topologically nontrivial superconductivity in this material. On the other hand, many aspects of our data are not readily explained by current theories for TSC. For example, we neither observe in-gap states (and in Ref. ) at the step edge as would be expected for a two-dimensional TSC , nor do we observe in-gap states corresponding to Majorana fermions on the surface as expected for a three- dimensional TSC . It is still mysterious why the predicted point nodes appear to be gapped out and why the long axis of Δ Ã LE rotates under high B == . In short, our findings reveal the microscopic behavior of the nematic superconductivity in Cu x Bi 2 Se 3, which will facilitate an understanding of its extraordinary properties and micro- scopic pairing mechanism, and more importantly, our data impose strong constraints for further improving theories of topological superconductivity.</p>
