		<p>Magnetic Penetration Depth Measurements of <material>Pr 2−x Ce x CuO 4−δ Films</material> on Buffered Substrates: Evidence for a Nodeless Gap</p>
		<p>We report measurements of the inverse squared magnetic penetration depth, λ −2 (T ), in <material>Pr2−xCexCuO 4−δ (0.115 ≤ x ≤ 0.152) superconducting films grown on SrTiO3</material> (001) substrates coated with a buffer layer of insulating Pr2CuO4. λ −2 (0), <tc>Tc</tc> and normal-state <me_method>resistivities</me_method> of these films indicate that they are clean and homogeneous. Over a wide range of Ce doping, <material>0.124 ≤ x ≤ 0.144</material>, λ −2 (T ) at low T is flat: it changes by less than 0.15% over a factor of 3 change in T , indicating a gap in the superconducting density of states. Fits to the first 5% decrease in λ −2 (T ) produce values of the minimum superconducting gap in the range of 0.29 ≤ ∆min/kBTc ≤ 1.01.</p>
		<p>It is still a puzzle whether pairing symmetry in n-type <class>cuprates</class> is d wave or not. Recently, novel concepts on pairing symmetry of n-and p-type <class>cuprates</class> have come forward: a possible transition in pairing symmetryand/or a mixed symmetry order parameter. Our previous workinvolved <material>La 2−x Ce x CuO 4−δ (LCCO)</material> and <material>Pr 2−x Ce x CuO 4−δ (PCCO)</material> films grown directly on SrTiO 3 substrates. We found that at low Ce doping levels, λ −2 (T ) at low T was quadratic in T , but at higher dopings, λ −2 (T ) showed activated behavior. These results suggested a d-to s-wave pairing transition near optimal doping, as was also suggested by tunneling experimentson <material>PCCO films</material>. We have subsequently improved film quality by eliminating the interface between the film and substrate, by growing <material id="7">PCCO films onto Pr 2 CuO 4 (PCO)/SrTiO 3</material> instead of directly onto SrTiO 3 . The insulating PCO layer is thought to lessen lattice mismatch between <material>PCCO film</material> and SrTiO 3 substrate, so that these films should be more homogeneous through their thickness. In fact, their normal state resistivities are somewhat lower than those of <material>unbuffered PCCO films</material> for the same doping, x. <tc>T c</tc> &#x27;s at optimal doping in the two film families are the same, <tc>T c</tc> ≃ <tcValue ptr="#7">24 K</tcValue>.</p>
		<p>Films were prepared by molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) on 10 mm × 10 mm × 0.35 mm SrTiO 3 substrates as detailed elsewhere. The same growth procedures and parameters were used for all films. For all films, <material>PCCO</material> and <material>PCO</material> layers are 750Å and 250Å thick, respectively. Ce concentrations, x, are measured to better than ±0.005 by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy. X-ray rocking curves show full-width at half maximum of (006) reflection for all films to be less than 0.4 • , which implies that the films are highly c-axis oriented.</p>
		<p>The penetration depth, λ(T ), was measured down to T ≃ 0.5 K using a mutual inductance apparatus, described in detail elsewhere, in a He 3 refrigerator. The system temperature was measured with a Cernox resistor (LakeShore Inc.) and its reliability, below 1 K, was confirmed by measuring the <tc>superconducting transition temperature</tc> of a <material id="14">Zn plate</material>, <tc>T c</tc> = <tcValue ptr="#14">0.875 K</tcValue>.</p>
		<p>Each film was centered between drive and pick-up coils with diameters of ∼ 1 mm. A small current at 50 kHz in the drive coil induced diamagnetic screening currents in the film, i.e., parallel to the CuO 2 planes. The time derivative of the net magnetic field from drive coil and induced current in the film was measured as a voltage across the pick-up coil. The real and imaginary parts of the mutual inductance are proportional to the quadrature and in-phase components of ac voltage, respectively. Because the coils were much smaller than the film, the applied field was concentrated near the center of the films, and demagnetizing effects at the film perimeter were not relevant. Because films were thinner than λ, the current density induced in the films was essentially uniform through the film thickness. Nonlinear effects occur only very close to <tc>T c</tc> where λ −2 is less than 1% of its value at T = 0. All data presented here represent linear response.</p>
		<p>The procedure to extract λ −2 (T ) from the measured mutual inductance is the following. First, a constant background mutual inductance due to stray couplings between drive and pickup circuits is subtracted from raw data. This background is the measured mutual inductance at 4.2 K with the sample replaced by a 100 micronthick superconducting Pb foil with identical shape and area. No magnetic field passes through the Pb foil. A glass shim ensures that the spacing between coils is the same as with the real sample. The adjusted data are normalized to the mutual inductance measured above <tc>T c</tc> , at T ∼ 30 K, where the film is utterly transparent to the ac field. Normalization reduces uncertainties associated with amplifier gains and nonideal aspects of the coil windings. A numerical model of the drive and pick-up coils enables us to convert the subtracted and normalized mutual inductance to sheet conductivity:</p>

The T dependence of λ −2 is unaffected by this uncertainty.</p>
		<p>Except for differences in the flatness of λ −2 at low T , which is the focal point of this paper, buffered films are very much like unbuffered films reported earlier. shows <me_method>in-plane resistivity</me_method>, ρ ab (T ), for buffered <material>PCCO films</material>. ρ ab in the normal state decreases smoothly and monotonically with Ce doping, x, even for small changes in x, implying that the main difference among films is Ce content. If there were random variations in degree of epitaxy, structural defects, etc., then <me_method>resistivity</me_method> would not be such a smooth function of x. These <me_method>resistivities</me_method> are slightly smaller than for <material>PCCO films</material> without buffer layers, and significantly lower than for <material>NCCO</material> and <material>PCCO</material> crystals. The inset of shows that resistive transitions are reasonably sharp, and that <tc>T c</tc> is a weak function of Ce concentration, although resistivity is not. summarizes properties of the films.</p>
		<p>Fluctuations cause σ 1 (T ) to peak at the <tc>superconducting transition</tc>. Hence, σ 1 (T ) is a much more stringent test of film quality than <me_method>resistivity</me_method>. For example, if <tc>T c</tc> varies through the film thickness, <me_method>resistivity</me_method> reveals only the <tc>highest T c</tc> . Because our probing magnetic field passes through the film, σ 1 (T ) has a peak at the <tc>T c</tc> of every layer. Transitions associated with small bad spots in the film, as opposed to an entire film layer, are distinguished by their having essentially no effect on the superfluid response, σ 2 . When a layer goes superconducting there is a distinct change in the slope of λ −2 (T ). σ 1 (T )&#x27;s of buffered <material>PCCO films</material> show that several of them have a double transition, reflected as shoulder (<material>x = 0.115, 0.124, and 0.137</material>) or satellite (<material>x = 0.144 and 0,152</material>) structure of peaks. We define two <tc>transition temperatures</tc>, <tc>T c1</tc> and <tc>T c2</tc> , from peaks in σ 1 (T ), where T c1 &gt; T c2 . The resistive <tc>T c</tc> is always at the onset of the T (K)</p>

For the films most important to the conclusions of this paper, <material>0.124 ≤ x ≤ 0.144</material>, the width of the <tc>T c1</tc> peak, ∆T c1 , is ≤ 1 K, indicating excellent film homogeneity. The peak at <tc>T c2</tc> most likely involves a bad spot in the film, since there is no corresponding feature in the slope of λ −2 (T ), (see ). Accordingly, the lower transition is neglected in our analysis. Films with highest and lowest Ce concentrations (<material>x = 0.115 and 0.152</material>) have broader transition widths (∆T c = 2.4 ∼ 3.9 K) than other films, perhaps because <tc>T c</tc> is more sensitive to x. shows λ −2 (T ) for all films. λ −2 (0) vs. x increases rapidly for <material>x ≤ 0.133</material>, and it is constant or decreases slowly for <material>x &gt; 0.133</material>. Values of λ −2 (0) are slightly higher than for unbuffered films. The surprising upward curvature that develops in λ −2 (T ) near <tc>T c</tc> at high Ce concentrations was also observed in unbuffered <material>LCCO</material> and <material>PCCO films</material>.</p>
		<p>In our previous workon <material>unbuffered PCCO films</material>, films with low Ce concentrations showed quadratic (T 2 ) behavior in λ −2 (T ) at low T . Films with high Ce concentrations showed gap-like behavior: where C ∞ and D are adjustable parameters, and t = T /T c . In the clean limit, D is approximately the minimum gap on the Fermi surface, normalized to k B <tc>T c</tc> , and C ∞ is roughly twice the average superconducting density of states (DOS) over energies within k B T of the gap edge. For isotropic BCS superconductors, the best-fit value of C ∞ /2 is about 2.2. The change in low-T behavior of λ −2 (T ) near optimal doping suggested a transition in pairing symmetry. We now turn to the low-T behavior of λ −2 (T ) for <material>buffered PCCO films</material>, shown on a greatly expanded scale in . The most important thing to notice is that λ −2 (T ) is flat to better than 0.15% over a factor of 3 or more change in T . Residual variations in λ −2 (T ) at the 0.1% level are due, at least in part, to slow drift in the gain of the lock-in amplifiers used to measure current and voltage. These data are incompatible with simple dwave models with nodes in the gap. Thus, except for the most underdoped and overdoped films (<material>x = 0.115 and 0.152</material>), λ −2 (T ) shows gapped behavior. Recent angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy measurementsindicate well-defined quasiparticle states on the Fermi surface where the d x 2 −y 2 node would be, so the gapped behavior that we observed could not be ascribed to a Fermi surface effect.</p>
		<p>To estimate the gap, we fit Eq. (1) to the first ∼ 5% drop in λ −2 (T ), (thin solid lines in . It comes as no surprise that quadratic fits over the same temperature range are unacceptable (dashed lines). For films with <material>x = 0.115 and 0.152</material>, data at T &lt; 0.5 K are needed to distinguish between T 2 and e −D/t . Values of the minimum gap, ∆ min = Dk B T c and average DOS, C ∞ /2, extracted from the above exponential fits are presented in . D values are significantly lower than the BCS weak-couplinglimit value, 1.76, for s-wave superconductors (2.14 for d-wave superconductors). D is largest, D ∼ 1, for <material>x near 0.13</material>. A similar value, D ≃ 0.85, was found for unbuffered <material>PCCO films</material> with the same Ce concentration. Values of C ∞ /2 (≪ 1) are also much smaller than for weakcoupling isotropic s wave. This implies existence of a peak in the DOS for a certain E (&gt; ∆ min ), because the states should be conserved.</p>
		<p>The next question is: where is the peak in the DOS, i.e., how big is the maximum gap, ∆ max , on the Fermi surface? To answer this question, we employ a model anisotropic gap function and the clean-limit result that 1 − λ −2 (T )/λ −2 (0) is an integral of quasiparticle DOS times the derivative of the Fermi function with respect to energy. shows a good fit to λ −2 (T ) for film with <material>x = 0.131</material> using the DOS in the inset. In this fit, the minimum gap was fixed at the value found by fitting</p>
		<p>Expanded view of λ −2 (T ) at low T for <material>buffered Pr2−xCexCuO 4−δ films</material>. Thin solid and dashed lines denote best fits of λ −2 (0)[1−C∞ exp(−D/t)] and λ −2 (0)[1−(T /T0) 2 ] to the first 5% drop in λ −2 (T ), respectively. the low-T data, i.e., ∆ min /k B T c = 0.99. Then, as one can see in inset of Fig. 5, the average DOS within ∼ k B T of the minimum gap edge agrees well with C ∞ /2 = 0.5 from . For film with <material>x = 0.131</material>, ∆ max is about 2.6k B T c (±15%).</p>
		<p>We emphasize that we cannot say anything about the shape of the peak in the DOS, only its location. An equally acceptable fit, with a similar peak energy, is obtained even when the sharp narrow peak in the inset of is replaced by a rectangular peak.</p>
		<p>In summary, we measured the inverse squared magnetic penetration depth, λ −2 (T ), of several <material>Pr 2−x Ce x CuO 4−δ films on buffered Pr 2 CuO 4 /SrTiO 3</material> substrates down to T /T c &lt; 0.03. Overall, the <me_method>resistivities</me_method> and penetration depths were similar to films grown directly on SrTiO 3 . However, for <material>PCCO films on buffered substrates</material>, λ −2 (T ) at low T exhibits gapped behavior over a wide range of Ce doping, including underdoping. This implies a superconducting gap without nodes on the Fermi surface. Values of the minimum superconducting gap for the films are in range of 0.3 ≤ ∆ min /k B T c ≤ 1.0. We cannot distinguish among models with various gap symmetries, e.g., anisotropic s, s + id, or d + id.</p>
