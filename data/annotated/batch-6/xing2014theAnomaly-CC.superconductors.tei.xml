          <p>The Cu substitution effect on the superconductivity of <rs type="material">LiFeAs</rs> has been studied in comparison with Co/Ni substitution. It is found that the shrinking rate of the lattice parameter c for Cu substitution is much smaller than that of Co/Ni substitution. This is in conjugation with the observation of ARPES that shows almost the same electron and hole Fermi surfaces (FSs) size for <rs type="material">undoped and Cu substituted LiFeAs</rs> sample, except for a very small hole band sinking below Fermi level with doping. This indicates that there is little doping effect at Fermi surface by Cu substitution, in sharp contrast to the more effective carrier doping effect by Ni or Co.</p>

      <p>Since the discovery of <rs type="material">La[O 1−x F x ]FeAs</rs> in 2008 , various classes of <rs type="class">iron-based</rs> superconductors, such as '<rs type="class">122' '111'</rs> or , are reported . These <rs type="class">iron based</rs> superconductors contain superconducting [FePn(Se)] (where Pn is pnictide element of As or P) layers which are interlaced by charge carrier reservoir layers. Most of their parent compounds are in the form of antiferromagnetic spin density wave (SDW) states. The antiferromagnetism can be suppressed by either introducing charge carrier or applying pressure, leading to superconductivity. Superconductivity can be induced by various methods of element substitution, either in the plane of [FePn(Se)] layer, or out of the plane. For instance, in the case of <rs type="material">BaFe 2 As 2</rs> , K-substitution at the Ba site, Co or Ni substitution at the Fe site, or P substitution at the As site, will induce superconductivity respectively . The partial replacement of Ba 2+ ion by K + ion will introduce hole- like charge carrier to the system, while chemical pressure is applied when As atoms are substituted partially by P atoms. However, the effect of substitution at Fe site is quite different . It seems that both Co or Ni substitution at Fe site introduce itinerant electrons, as experimentally indicated by Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.

ARPES and transport measurements , or x-ray emission spectroscopy measurements . On the other hand, the density-functional studies of the <rs type="material">Fe 1−x Cu x Se</rs> show that, although Cu serves as an effective electron dopant, it is still a source of strong scattering . Recently, the ARPES studies of <rs type="material">Ba(Fe 1−x Cu x ) 2 As 2</rs> and the work on <rs type="material">NaFe 1−x Cu x As</rs> have revealed that part of electrons doped by substitution of Cu are almost localized.</p>
      <p>To date, the research on this issue is mainly limited to the <rs type="material">Ba-122</rs> system, since it is relative easy to grow high quality single crystals. In fact, <rs type="class">'1 1 1' type iron based</rs> superconductors are unique. In the structure of <rs type="class">'1 1 1' type</rs> compounds, the [FePn] layers are intercalated with two layers of alkali metals atoms . The '<rs type="class">1 1 1</rs>' system shows systematic evolution of superconductivity as a function of Co/Ni doping or pressure . The crystal can be easily cleaved and results in equivalent and neutral counterparts with identical surface versus bulk electronic structures, which is favored by ARPES . Moreover, it can be referred as an electron over doped superconductor . When doped with Co/Ni in the parent <rs type="material">LiFeAs</rs>, it presents no SDW transition and no dome like superconducting phase diagram, but a linear suppression of <rs type="tc">T c</rs>, making this compound a good candidate for studying the effect of TM substitution. So far, the reported chemical doping effect of <rs type="material">LiFeAs</rs> is limited to Co/Ni substitution . In this work, we study the effect of Cu substitution in comparison with Co/Ni substitution on the superconductivity of <rs type="material">single crystals in LiFeAs</rs> system. We found that the behaviour of Cu substitution is quite different from that of Co/Ni substitution in that most of the 3 d electrons from Cu dopant are mostly localized.</p>
      <p><rs type="material">Single crystals of LiFe 1−x TM x As(TM = Cu, Co/Ni)</rs> were grown by self-flux method, using Li As, As and Fe 1−x TM x As powder as the starting materials. The precursor As was obtained by mixing Li lump and As powder, which was then sealed in an evacuated titanium tube and sintered at 650 • C for 10 h. Fe 1−x TM x As were prepared by mixing Fe, Cu (or Co/Ni) and As powder thoroughly, pressed into pellets, sealed in a evacuated quartz tube and sintered at 700 • C for 30 h. To ensure the homogeneity of the product, these pellets were grounded and heated again. The stoichiometric amount of Li As, Fe 1−x TM x As and As powder were weighed according to the element ratio of Li(Fe 1−x TM x ) 0.3 As. The mixture was grounded and put into alumina crucible and sealed in Nb crucible under 1 atm of Argon gas. The Nb crucible was then sealed in the evacuated quartz tube, heated to 1100 • C and slowly cooled down to 700 • C at a rate of 3 • C hr −1 to grow single crystals. The obtained <rs type="material">LiFe 1−x TM x As single crystals</rs> have the typical size of 10×6×0.5 mm, as shown in figure 1(a). All sample preparations, except for sealing, were carried out in the glove box filled with high purity Argon gas.</p>
        <p>The element composition of the <rs type="material">LiFe 1−x TM x As single crystals</rs> was checked by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). These single crystals were characterized by x-ray diffraction. The transport measurements were carried on commercial physical properties measurement system (PPMS) using the four probe method. The <rs type="me_method">dc magnetic susceptibility</rs> was measured with a magnetic field of 30 Oe using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). ARPES studies were performed at beam lines PGM and Apple-PGM of the Synchrotron Radiation Center, Wisconsin, equipped with Scienta R4000 analyzer and SES 200 analyzer, respectively. The energy and angular resolutions of the ARPES measurements were set at 20-25 meV and 0.2 • , respectively. The samples were cleaved in situ and measured at 30 K under a vacuum of 5 × 10 −11 torr. The incident photon energy was chosen to be hν = 51 eV.</p>
        <p>The element composition checked by EDS is close to the nominal one. Thus, here the nominal concentration is used in the sample chemical formula. The typical x-ray diffraction pattern of the 0 0 l reflections for <rs type="material">LiFe 1−x TM x As single crystal</rs> is shown in . From the diffraction pattern, the lattice constant c was calculated and the obtained c-axis values were plotted as a function of doping level x for Cu, Co/Ni substituted samples (as shown in ), indicating a successful chemical substitution. However, in the case of Cu substituted samples, the lattice constant c shrinks by ∼0.06% at the doping level <rs type="material">x = 0.06</rs>; while for the Co/Ni substituted samples at the same doping level, the c value decreases by ∼0.3%, which is</p>

For undoped <rs type="material" xml:id="x30">LiFeAs crystal</rs>, the <rs corresp="#x31" type="me_method">resistivity</rs> drops sharply to zero at <rs corresp="#x30" type="tcValue" xml:id="x31">∼17 K</rs> with a narrow <rs type="tc">superconducting transition</rs> width T ∼1.1 K and the residual resistivity ration (RRR), defined as the ratio of the resistivity at 300 K and residual resistivity ρ 0 , which is determined by extending from the range right above <rs type="tc">T c</rs> found to be 60. Upon Cu doping, the effect of its scattering on electron mobility increases and leads to the increase of resistivity (as shown in ), implying the localization of doping carriers from Cu that acts more like an impurity center. The <rs corresp="#x37" type="me_method">magnetic susceptibility</rs> of <rs type="material" xml:id="x35">LiFeAs crystal</rs> shown in figure 2(b) suggests bulk superconductivity with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> <rs corresp="#x35" type="tcValue" xml:id="x37">∼ 16 K</rs>, which is defined by the bifurcation point between ZFC and FC <rs type="me_method">magnetic susceptibility</rs> as consistent with transport data.

        <p>Figures 4(a) and 4(b) are the transport and magnetic properties for <rs type="material">LiFe 1−x Ni x As crystals</rs> respectively, while the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> value versus Ni-doping level is plotted and fitted linearly as shown in figure 4(c). <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is linearly suppressed by Ni doping with a rate of about 2.2 K per 1% Ni doping. We found that the suppression rate of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> for Ni substitution is twice that of Co substitution, implying that Co and Ni substitution introduce one and two more itinerant electrons respectively, which is consistent with the change of lattice parameter. Similar behavior had been observed in Co and <rs type="material">Ni doped Ba 122</rs> system .</p>
        <p>To further verify the localization tendency of Cu doped electron, which is different with the Co/Ni substitution with less change of lattice parameter for Cu doping (as shown in ), we measured the electronic structure by using APRES technique in order to get a straightforward electronic structure picture of <rs type="material">Cu doped LiFeAs</rs>. It has been experimentally proven that the surface of <rs type="material">LiFeAs</rs> preserves its bulk properties. Therefore ARPES reflects the intrinsic properties for the <rs type="material">LiFeAs crystals</rs>. Previously ARPES were used to study the Fermi surface evaluation when Fe is partially substituted by Co . The results show that Co substitution introduces electron type charge carriers and results in chemical potential shifting upwards, indicating electron doping. The Fermi surface (FS) mappings along the -M high symmetry line from ARPES for <rs type="material">undoped and Cu 6% doped LiFeAs</rs> are shown in figures 5(a) and 5(b), respectively. To check how FSs change with Cu substitution, extracted k F locus were plotted in figures 5(a), 5(b) and 5(e), respectively. Red circles and green triangles represent undoped and <rs type="material">Cu 6% doped Li(Fe 1−x Cu x )As</rs>, respectively. The results reveal no significant difference in these two different crystals, except for the small hole FS observed in <rs type="material">LiFeAs</rs>, which disappeared in the <rs type="material">Cu 6% doped Li(Fe 1−x Cu x )As</rs>, indicating small electron doping effect. Additionally, the normal state (T = 30 K) high resolution ARPES intensity plots along the -M high symmetry line are shown in figures 5(c) and 5(d), respectively. The incident light was set to 51 eV (k z = 0) with its polarization perpendicular to the mirror plane to select odd symmetry orbitals. Red and green solid circles were used to extract the band dispersion, which generates the small hole FS in <rs type="material">LiFeAs</rs>. It is clear that the extracted band crosses E F in <rs type="material">LiFeAs</rs> but sinks below E F in Cu 6% sample. Our results show that, unlike <rs type="material">Co and Ni substituted LiFeAs</rs> , where extra electrons cause Fermi level to shift, the FSs of Cu substituted <rs type="material">LiFeAs</rs> remained almost intact. Hence, the 3 d electrons from Cu dopant in <rs type="material">LiFeAs</rs> are more localized and contribute little to the FSs. Berlijn et al studied disorder effects of <rs type="material">Co and Zn substitution in Ba122</rs> system . They found that the calculated Femi surface behaviors of Zn substitution induced deep impurity level that is quite different from the effect of Co doping. Recently Ideta et al reported strong localization effects in <rs type="material">Zn substituted BaFe 2 As 2</rs>, wherein all the extra electrons are localized at the state of ∼10 eV below FSs and do not contribute to the chemical potential shift at all . Our results can be explained from the d-band partial density of states of Co, Ni and Cu in iron based superconductors. The behavior of Co or Ni substitution follows a rigid band model due to the fact that the d-bands of Co and Ni overlap with Fe d-band and are featureless compared with Fe d-band; whereas Cu presents deeper impurity potential of ∼4 eV , which localizes most of the Cu 3 d orbital electrons. This is consistent with the lesser contraction of lattice parameters</p>

        <p>by Cu substitution compared with Co/Ni substitution, where in itinerant electrons are induced. Although there is a small electron doping effect by Cu substitution in <rs type="material">LiFeAs</rs> system, the doped coherent electrons would be even smaller considering the effect of disorder with strong impurity potential . Hence, the suppression of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> by Cu substitution is mainly from strong impurity scattering instead of carrier density change.</p>
        <p>Here we found that Cu doping results in the sinking of the small hole band below E F in <rs type="material">LiFe 0.94 Cu 0.06 As</rs> which contributes to approximately only 1% mobile electron carriers(normalized to 0.17 electron / Cu doping). Therefore, the Cu doping is more localized in <rs type="material">LiFeAs</rs> system and quantitatively different from Cu doped other systems . For example, the practical doped mobile carriers in <rs type="material">Ba(Fe 1−x Cu x ) 2 As 2</rs> are about 1 electron per Cu as calculated from the change of the Fermi Surface volume, which is much higher than 0.17 electron per Cu in our <rs type="material">LiFeAs</rs> system.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, it is interesting to compare Cu doping with Ru doping. Since Ru is isovalent to Fe (within the same column in periodic table), Ru doping will not introduce carriers theoretically. The experiments of ARPES verified that Ru is isoelectronic substitution . Therefore, Cu doping versus Ru doping represent two typical cases that do not introduce carriers. However, the mechanism is different, as for Cu doping case the 'carriers' are localized, while for Ru doping there is no additional carriers induced.</p>
        <p>In summary, series of <rs type="material">LiFe 1−x Cu x As single crystals</rs> were grown by self-flux method. Based on systematic investigations of superconducting transitions, crystal versus electronic structure evolution with Cu doping level, we found that behaviors of Cu substitution are different from those of Co/Ni substitution in both change rates of <rs type="tc">Tc</rs>, as well as lattice parameters as function of doping level. ARPES measurements indicated that most of the 3 d valence electrons from Cu dopant are localized, resulting in almost intact Fermi surfaces for <rs type="material">Cu doped LiFeAs</rs> except for a very small hole band sinking below Fermi level, which is also quite different from the doping effects in other systems.</p>
