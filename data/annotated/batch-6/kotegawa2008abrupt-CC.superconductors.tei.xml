      <p>After the discovery of superconductivity at <rs corresp="#x11" type="tcValue">26 K</rs> in <rs type="material" xml:id="x11">F-doped system LaFeAsO 1−x F x (ZrCuSiAs-type struc- ture)</rs>, 1 various <rs type="class">Fe-based</rs> materials have been reported to show superconductivity. Among them, <rs type="material">AFe 2 As 2 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba)</rs> systems with a ThCr 2 Si 2 -type structure show <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> by doping with K or Cs into the A site, or by doping Co into the Fe site. Doping is an effective method of inducing superconductivity in <rs type="class">Fe-based</rs> superconductors. However, this simultaneously induces the inhomogeneity of the crystal structure and electronic state. The inhomogeneity sometimes makes it difficult to observe the intrinsic properties of the mate- rial.</p>
      <p>Instead of doping, the application of pressure for un- doped compound is also an effective method of induc- ing superconductivity. Pressure-induced superconductiv- ity in <rs type="material">AFe 2 As 2 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba)</rs> has been re- ported. The superconductivity of these stoichiomet- ric compounds is important for the study of <rs type="class">Fe-based</rs> su- perconductors. Concerning <rs type="material">CaFe 2 As 2</rs> , its superconduc- tivity has been recognized to be intrinsic, because some groups have reported that the <rs type="tc">zero-resistance state</rs> is observed in a similar pressure range. In the cases of <rs type="material">BaFe 2 As 2</rs> and <rs type="material">SrFe 2 As 2</rs> , Alireza et al. have reported that Meissner effects appear between 2.5 − 6.0 GPa for <rs type="material">BaFe 2 As 2</rs> and between 2.8 − 3.6 GPa for <rs type="material">SrFe 2 As 2</rs> using <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> measurements under pressure. However, Fukazawa et al. have observed no <rs type="tc">zero-resistance</rs> state at pressures of up to 13 GPa in <rs type="material">BaFe 2 As 2</rs> . 12 On the other hand, Kumar et al. performed <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x5-205">resistivity</rs> measurement at pressures of up to 3 GPa in <rs type="material">SrFe 2 As 2</rs> and reported that the <rs type="tc">onset of superconductivity</rs> appears above <rs type="pressure">2.5 GPa</rs>, but they observed no <rs type="tc">zero-resistance</rs> state up to 3 GPa. Quite recently, Igawa et al. have reported that the <rs type="tc">zero- resistance</rs> state was realized below <rs corresp="#x5-205,#x32" type="tcValue" xml:id="x30">10 K</rs> at a high pres- sure of <rs corresp="#x30" type="pressure">8 GPa</rs> in <rs type="material" xml:id="x32">SrFe 2 As 2</rs> , but that the transition was broad. 14 No consensus on pressure-induced superconduc- tivity in <rs type="material">BaFe 2 As 2</rs> and <rs type="material">SrFe 2 As 2</rs> has been arrived at yet.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we report the results of <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x6-10">resistivity</rs> mea- * surements in <rs type="material" xml:id="x35">single-crystalline samples of SrFe 2 As 2</rs> up to 4.3 GPa. This is the first resistivity measurement above 3 GPa using single-crystalline samples. In our measure- ments, the <rs type="tc">zero-resistance</rs> state below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x6-10,#x35" type="tcValue" xml:id="x38">34 K</rs> with a sharp transition was observed above <rs corresp="#x38" type="pressure">3.5 GPa</rs>.</p>
      <p>Single-crystalline samples were prepared by the Sn- flux method as reported in ref. . <rs type="me_method">Electrical resistiv- ity</rs> (ρ) measurement at high pressures was carried out using an indenter cell. ρ was measured by a four- probe method while introducing a flow of current along the ab plane. Daphne oil 7373 was used as a pressure- transmitting medium. Applied pressure was estimated from the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of the lead manometer. <rs type="me_method">Resistivity</rs> measure- ment under pressure was performed for two settings us- ing different samples and almost the same results were obtained between two samples.</p>
      <p>a) and 1(b) show the temperature depen- dences of ρ at several pressures of up to 4.3 GPa. A clear anomaly was observed at 198 K at ambient pressure, which is similar to that of Yan et al.'s sample. This tem- perature, denoted as T 0 , corresponds to the structural transition temperature and the simultaneous magnetic transition temperature. The magnetic structure of <rs type="material">SrFe 2 As 2</rs> has been reported to be a collinear antiferro- magnetic (AFM) one. The T 0 of our sample is lower than that of Kumar et al.'s sample. ρ shows a small jump at T 0 in our sample and the jump becomes remark- able under pressure, in contrast to other measurements under pressure. The reason why the jump appears in our sample is unclear at present, but this behavior is understood to be induced by the reconstruction of the Fermi surface owing to the AFM transition, and resem- bles that of <rs type="material">CaFe 2 As 2</rs> . 8, 9 Thus, we define the temper- ature at the jump as T 0 on the analogy of <rs type="material">CaFe 2 As 2</rs> , as shown in . As shown in the figure, T 0 de- creases with increasing pressure and reaches ∼ 100 K at 3.57 GPa. No signature of the transition at T 0 was ob- served above 3.77 GPa, indicating the disappearance of the AFM state. The critical pressure between the AFM state and the paramagnetic (PM) state is estimated to</p>

A small hysteresis was observed between cooling and warming, indicative of the first-order phase transition.

      <p>is the pressure-temperature phase diagram around the phase boundary. We plotted the <rs type="tc">onset tem- perature of superconductivity</rs>, <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> , and the transition width, ∆T c = T onset c − T c . The <rs type="tc">zero-resistance</rs> state is observed even in the narrow pressure range below P c . In the <rs type="class">Fe-based</rs> superconductors, it is a controversial is- sue whether superconductivity can coexist with the AFM state. Since the <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> is macroscopic measure- ment and is sensitive to superconductivity, it is generally difficult to discuss this issue. However, note that ∆T c is unusually wide below P c . In contrast, ∆T c becomes markedly sharper above P c . The minimum ∆T c is 0.75 K at 3.83 GPa. This indicates that the PM state fa- vors superconductivity and that the AFM state prevents the occurrence of superconductivity in <rs type="material">SrFe 2 As 2</rs> . The su- perconductivity with a wide ∆T c below P c implies non bulk superconductivity. The transition from the tetrag- onal structure to the orthorhombic one is of the first order. As seen in the inset of , the transition at T 0 is of the first order even close to P c . At high pres- sures and low temperatures, the pressure distribution is inevitable. If the transition at P c is of the first order, the pressure distribution is expected to induce phase separa- tion. We speculate that the observed superconductivity below P c originates from the phase-separated PM phase. This is supported by the fact that <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> is almost in- dependent of pressure below P c . However, if the phase separation is realized at around P c , we expect the en- hancement of ρ at low temperatures at around P c owing to scattering at the domain boundary. As shown in , there is no anomalous behavior in ρ(35K) at around P c within experimental error. The phase separation and co- existence of superconductivity and magnetism are still an open question, and confirmation by microscopic mea- surements is required.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, the pressure-temperature phase diagram of <rs type="material" xml:id="x87">SrFe 2 As 2</rs> has been reported by three groups. Our phase diagram is almost consistent with that of Kumar et al., although their <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> mea- surements have been performed only up to 3 GPa. On the other hand, the phase diagrams by Alireza et al.</p>
      <p>and Igawa et al. are different from ours. Alireza et al. have used a single-crystalline sample and Daphne oil 7373 as a pressure transmitting medium, which are the same as those used in our measurements. In their phase diagram, the <rs type="tc">superconductivity of T c</rs>
      <rs corresp="#x87" type="tcValue" xml:id="x89">∼ 27 K</rs> appears abruptly at <rs corresp="#x89" type="pressure">2.8 GPa</rs> and <rs type="tc">disappears</rs> above <rs type="pressure">3.6 GPa</rs>. The pres- sure region of superconductivity is quite different. On the other hand, Igawa et al. have used a polycrystalline sample, and Fluorinert (FC-77:FC-70 = 1:and <rs type="material">NaCl</rs> as a pressure transmitting medium. The <rs type="tc">onset of super- conductivity</rs> was observed in a wide pressure range, and zero <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x14-134">resistance</rs>
      <rs corresp="#x14-134" type="tcValue" xml:id="x93">below 10 K</rs> was realized at a high pres- sure of <rs corresp="#x93" type="pressure">8 GPa</rs>. The <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> at around <rs type="pressure">3 − 4 GPa</rs> is almost the same as that in our measurements, but the <rs type="tc">zero- resistance</rs> state is different. In their phase diagram, the AFM state is drawn to survive up to 8 GPa. The dif- ferences between samples and/or pressure-transmitting mediums are considered to induce the inconsistency be- tween the obtained phase diagrams.</p>
      <p>To summarize, we have investigated the <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> un- der pressure in a <rs type="material">single-crystalline SrFe 2 As 2</rs> up to 4.3 GPa. According to our <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x10020">resistivity</rs> measurement, the mag- netically ordered phase most likely disappears abruptly above P c ∼ <rs corresp="#x101" type="pressure">3.6 − 3.7 GPa</rs>, and superconductivity ap- pears above approximately P c ; however, other experi- mental methods are required to confirm whether this phase diagram reflects bulk properties. The <rs type="tc">maximum T c</rs> was <rs corresp="#x102,#x10020" type="tcValue" xml:id="x101">34.1 K</rs> for the pressure-induced superconductivity in stoichiometric <rs type="material" xml:id="x102">SrFe 2 As 2</rs> , which is close to <rs corresp="#x104" type="tcValue">37 − 38 K</rs> of the <rs type="material" xml:id="x104">doped systems</rs>. The <rs type="tc">maximum T c</rs> is realized in the PM state close to P c . This gives us two different scenar- ios. One is that the instability of the AFM state plays an important role in superconductivity. Another is that the AFM state obstructs the optimized situation for higher <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . Systematic investigations are needed to elucidate the relation between superconductivity and magnetism, but the stoichiometric system <rs type="material">SrFe 2 As 2</rs> is a good candidate for treating this issue.</p>
