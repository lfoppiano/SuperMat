        <p>Pressure plays an essential role in the induction 1 and control 2,3 of superconductivity in <rs type="class">iron-based</rs> superconductors. Substitution of a large cation by a smaller rare-earth ion to simulate the pressure effects has raised the <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs> <rs type="tc">T C</rs> to a record high of <rs type="tcValue">55 K</rs> in these materials 4,5 . Analogous to the bell-shaped curve of <rs type="tc">T C</rs> dependence on chemical doping, <rs type="tc">pressure-tuned T C</rs> typically drops monotonically after passing the optimal pressure 1-3 . Here we report the observations of an unexpected phenomenon in superconducting <rs type="class">iron chalcogenides</rs> that after the <rs type="tc">T C</rs> dropped from the maximum of <rs type="tcValue" xml:id="x12">32 K</rs> at <rs corresp="#x12" type="pressure">1 GPa</rs> and vanished (<rs type="tcValue">&lt; 4 K</rs>) above 9.5 GPa, a second superconducting region with considerably higher <rs type="tc">T C</rs> than the first maximum suddenly reemerged above 11.5 GPa. The <rs type="tc">T C</rs> of the reemerging superconducting phase reaches <rs type="tcValue" corresp="#x16,#x17,#x18">48.0-48.7 K</rs> for <rs type="material" xml:id="x16">Tl 0.6 Rb 0.4 Fe 1.67 Se 2</rs> , <rs type="material" xml:id="x17">K 0.8 Fe 1.7 Se 2</rs> and <rs type="material" xml:id="x18">K 0.8 Fe 1.78 Se 2</rs> , setting a new <rs type="tc">T C</rs> record for iron chalcogenide superconductors.</p>

    <p>The recent discoveries of <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> at <rs type="tcValue">30-32 K</rs> in a new family of <rs type="class">iron-based chalcogenide</rs> superconductors 6-9 <rs type="material" xml:id="x22">A 1-x Fe 2-y Se 2 (A=K, Rb or Cs, with possible Tl substitution)</rs> bring new excitement to the field of superconductivity 10 . Some of the most striking features of such superconductors include the unusually large magnetic moments up to 3.3 ÔÅ≠ B per Fe atom and the Fe-vacancy ordering in the Fe square lattice 11 . How superconductivity with such a high <rs type="tc">T C</rs> can exist on such a strong magnetic background remains perplexing 10 . It has been established that the superconductivity in strongly correlated electronic systems can be dictated by their crystallographic structure, electronic charge, as well as orbital and spin degree of freedom, which in turn, can be manipulated by controlling parameters including pressure, magnetic field, and chemical composition 12-15 . Pressure is a 'clean' way to tune basic electronic and structural properties without changing the chemistry. High-pressure studies are thus very useful in elucidating mechanisms of superconductivity as well as in searching for new high-T C superconducting materials.</p>
    <p>We studied single crystals of <rs type="material">Tl 0.6 Rb 0.4 Fe 1.67 Se 2</rs> , <rs type="material">K 0.8 Fe 1.7 Se 2</rs> and <rs type="material">K 0.8 Fe 1.78 Se 2</rs> grown by the Bridgman method . We have conducted both high-pressure <rs type="me_method">resistance</rs> and <rs type="me_method">susceptibility measurements</rs> to detect superconductivity in-situ at high pressures and low temperatures. Figure shows temperature dependence of the electrical <rs type="me_method">resistance</rs> at different pressures for <rs type="material" xml:id="x26">Tl 0.6 Rb 0.4 Fe 1.67 Se 2 single crystals</rs>. Here we define <rs type="tc">T C</rs> as the intersection of the tangent through the inflection point of the resistive transition with a straight-line fit of the normal state just above the transition. As can be seen, <rs type="tc">T C</rs> starts at the maximum of <rs corresp="#x26,#x4-183" type="tcValue" xml:id="x29">33 K</rs> at <rs corresp="#x29" type="pressure">1.6 GPa</rs>, shifts to lower temperatures at increasing pressures, and vanishes near 9 GPa in our experimental temperature range, which is 300-4 K for our high-pressure <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x4-183">resistance</rs> measurements (Figure ). At slightly higher pressures, however, an unexpected superconducting phase reemerges with an <rs type="tc">onset T C</rs> as high as <rs corresp="#x26" type="tcValue" xml:id="x32">48.0 K</rs> at <rs corresp="#x32" type="pressure">12.4 GPa</rs> (Figure ). The sample <rs type="tc">is not superconducting</rs> at pressures higher than 13.2 GPa. We repeated the measurements with new samples in three independent experiments, and the results were reproducible.</p>
    <p>To confirm the pressure-induced changes of superconductivity in <rs type="material" xml:id="x35">Tl 0.6 Rb 0.4 Fe 1.67 Se 2</rs> , we also performed magnetic ac <rs type="me_method">susceptibility measurements</rs> in-situ at high pressures (Figure ). The value of <rs type="tc">T C</rs> is taken to be the <rs type="tc">onset of superconductivity</rs> defined by the intersection of a line drawn through the steep slope of the curve and the region of zero slope above the transition. The magnetic study showed that <rs type="tc">T C</rs> decreased with increasing pressure and vanished at 9.8 GPa in the first superconducting phase SC-I (Figure ).</p>
    <p>With further increasing pressure, the material enters a new superconducting phase SC-II and its <rs type="tc">transition temperature</rs> reaches <rs corresp="#x35,#x43" type="tcValue" xml:id="x41">40.2 K</rs> at <rs corresp="#x41" type="pressure">12.2 GPa</rs> (Figure ). The <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x43">magnetic measurements</rs> yield <rs type="tc">T C</rs> values consistent with the <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> data within the experimental uncertainties. These results provide convincing evidence for the existence of two distinct superconducting phases in <rs type="material">Tl 0.6 Rb 0.4 Fe 1.67 Se 2</rs>.</p>
    <p>To investigate whether the pressure-induced reemergence of superconductivity was unique to <rs type="material">Tl 0.6 Rb 0.4 Fe 1.67 Se 2</rs> or more general among <tc type="class">iron chalcogenides</tc>, we conducted parallel electrical <rs type="me_method">resistance</rs> measurements on <rs type="material">K 0.8 Fe 1.7 Se 2 single crystals</rs>, and observed nearly identical behaviour (Figure ). The initial <rs type="tc">T C</rs> of <rs type="tcValue" xml:id="x60">32 K</rs> at <rs corresp="#x60" type="pressure">0.8-1.6 GPa</rs> decreased monotonically with increasing pressure and became undetectable at 9.2 GPa. At a slightly increased pressure, the second superconducting phase of <rs type="material" xml:id="x62">K 0.8 Fe 1.7 Se 2</rs> reemerged and reached the <rs type="tc">maximum T C</rs> of <rs corresp="#x62" type="tcValue" xml:id="x64">48.7 K</rs> at <rs corresp="#x64" type="pressure">12.5 GPa</rs>. We repeated the experiment six times using six single crystals cut from different batches, and the results were reproducible. We further repeated the measurements with a slightly different composition, <rs type="material">K 0.8 Fe 1.78 Se 2</rs>, and again, observed similar pressure-induced behaviour.</p>
    <p>We summarized the pressure dependence of <rs type="tc">T C</rs> of <rs type="material">Tl 0.6 Rb 0.4 Fe 1.67 Se 2</rs> , <rs type="material">K 0.8 Fe 1.7 Se 2</rs> , and <rs type="material">K 0.8 Fe 1.78 Se 2</rs> in Figure and Table -S4 of Supplementary Information. The diagram clearly reveals two distinct superconducting regions: the initial superconducting phase SC-I and the pressure-induced superconducting phase SC-II. In the SC-I region, <rs type="tc">T C</rs> is suppressed with applied pressure and approaches zero between 9.2 and 9.8 GPa. At higher pressures, the SC-II region appears, in which the <rs type="tc">T C</rs> is even higher than the <rs type="tc">maximum T C</rs> of the SC-I region. The SC-II region has a <rs type="tc">maximum T C</rs> of <rs corresp="#x76" type="tcValue">48.7 K</rs> for <rs type="material" xml:id="x76">K 0.8 Fe 1.7 Se 2</rs> and <rs corresp="#x78" type="tcValue">48.0 K</rs> for <rs type="material" xml:id="x78">Tl 0.6 Rb 0.4 Fe 1.67 Se 2</rs> , setting the new T C record in <rs type="class">chalcogenide</rs> superconductors. The SC-II region appears in a narrow pressure range. Unlike the usual parabolic pressure-tuning curve of <rs type="tc">T C</rs> , the high T C in SC-II appears abruptly above 9.8 GPa and disappears equally abruptly above 13.2 GPa. Intermediate <rs type="tc">T C</rs> <rs type="tcValue">&lt;38 K</rs> is not observed even with small pressure increment steps of 0.1 GPa. A similar reemergence of superconductivity has been observed in some other strongly correlated electronic systems, such as <rs type="class">heavy-fermion</rs> and organic systems .</p>
    <p>Our preliminary high-pressure polycrystalline X-ray diffraction results of the two <rs type="class">iron chalcogenides</rs> <rs type="material">K 0.8 Fe 1.7 Se 2</rs> and <rs type="material">K 0.8 Fe 1.78 Se 2</rs> confirm that, to the first degree, the basic tetragonal crystal structure persists throughout the pressure range studied (Supplementary Information). Therefore, the disappearance of <rs type="tc">T C</rs> in SC-I, the reemergence of higher <rs type="tc">T C</rs> in SC-II, and the final non-superconducting region reflect detailed structural variances within the basic tetragonal unit cell, that are awaiting in-depth investigations with advanced diagnostic probes in the future. For instance, the possible change in magnetic-ordering structures would require high-pressure neutron diffraction, and the possible superlattice and Fe vacancy ordering would require high-pressure single-crystal X-ray structural investigations.</p>
    <p>The pressure dependence of <rs type="tc">T C</rs> in the SC-I region is expected but its mechanism is still heavily debated. Quantum criticalities are thought to play important roles in superconductivity for strongly correlated electronic systems . A characteristic feature of the new iron chalcogenide superconductors is the existence of Fe-vacancies in the Fe-square lattice, ordered by a ‚àö5√ó‚àö5 superstructure . It remains unclear whether pressure could destroy the vacancy ordering at a critical value and drive the materials into a disordered lattice. Detailed structural studies of these superconducting behaviours in the <rs type="class">iron chalcogenide</rs> superconductors are currently being conducted. The information on magnetic properties at high pressures is highly desired in order to understand the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in these <rs type="class">iron chalcogenides</rs>.</p>
    <p>The surprising observation of the SC-II region with the reemerging higher <rs type="tc">T C</rs> is totally unexpected. It will certainly stimulate a great deal of future experimental and theoretical studies to clarify whether the observed reemergence of superconductivity in <rs type="class">iron cholcogenides</rs> is associated with the quantum critical transition, magnetism, superstructure, vacancy ordering, and spin fluctuation, etc.</p>
