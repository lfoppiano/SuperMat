    <p>The newly discovered <rs type="class">iron-based</rs> superconductors have attracted much attention over the last three years -. Until now, various <rs type="class">Fe-based</rs> superconductors, such as <rs type="class">ZrCuSiAs-type</rs> <rs type="class">LnFeAsO</rs> (Ln stands for rare earth elements) -, <rs type="material">ThCr 2 Si 2 -type AeFe 2 As 2</rs> (Ae stands for alkali earth elements) , <rs type="class">Fe 2 As-type</rs> <rs type="material">AFeAs</rs> (A is Li or Na) -and <rs type="class">anti-PbO-type</rs> <rs type="material">Fe(Se, Te)</rs> , have been reported. The <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs type="class">anti-PbO-type</rs> <rs type="material" xml:id="x3-103">FeSe</rs> could reach <rs corresp="#x3-103" type="tcValue" xml:id="x13">37 K</rs> under <rs corresp="#x13" type="pressure">4.5 GPa</rs> from <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ⇠ <rs corresp="#x3-103" type="tcValue" xml:id="x16">8 K</rs> at <rs corresp="#x16" type="pressure">ambient pressure</rs> . Very recently, by intercalating K, Rb, Cs and Tl in between the FeSe layers, superconductivity was enhanced to about <rs corresp="#x19" type="tcValue">30 K</rs> without any external pressure in the <rs type="material" xml:id="x19">Fe-Se</rs> system -, and it provides a new type of <rs type="class">iron-based</rs> superconductor to explore high <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . For the <rs type="class">iron-pnictide</rs>, the pressure tends to destroy the magnetic transition in the undoped compounds, and <rs type="tc">T c increases</rs> with increasing pressure for underdoped <rs type="class">iron-pnictides</rs>, remaining approximately constant for optimal doping and decreasing linearly in the overdoped range . Superconductivity can be induced via pressure in the parent compounds <rs type="material">AFe 2 As 2 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu)</rs> -. Magnetism and superconductivity are strongly correlated with each other in <rs type="class">iron-based</rs> superconductors. The strong pressure effect in <rs type="material">FeSe</rs> may be related to its strongly enhanced antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations under pressure . Therefore, we wonder whether the strong pressure effect still exists in <rs type="material">A x Fe 2 Se 2</rs>. It is very meaningful to carry out high-pressure measurements in these newly found superconductors.</p>
    <p>In this paper, we systematically measured resistivity under high hydrostatic pressure up to 1.7 GPa for the newly discovered superconductors <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> and <rs type="material">Cs x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> . It is found that the <rs type="tc">transition temperature slightly increases</rs> below 0.82 GPa and gradually decreases with further increasing the pressure for <rs type="material">Cs x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> . Two <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 single crystals</rs> with different <rs type="tc">T c</rs> were measured. For the <rs type="material" xml:id="x34">K x Fe 2 Se 2 crystal</rs> with <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x34" type="tcValue">32.6 K</rs> and a broad hump centered at 245 K, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> gradually decreases with increasing pressure. While <rs type="tc">T c</rs> versus pressure shows similar behavior to <rs type="material">Cs x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> , <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> reaches its maximum value of <rs corresp="#x43" type="tcValue" xml:id="x41">32.7 K</rs> under the pressure of <rs corresp="#x41" type="pressure">0.48 GPa</rs> for the <rs type="material" xml:id="x43">K x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> with <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x43" type="tcValue">31.1 K</rs> and a broad hump centered at 130 K. All of these results suggest that there exists an optimal doping with maximum <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . <rs type="tc">T c increases</rs> with increasing pressure for the underdoped sample, and monotonically decreases in the overdoped range. The resistivity hump shifts to high temperature with increasing pressure.</p>
    <p><rs type="material">Single crystal A x Fe 2 Se 2 (A = K, Cs)</rs> was grown by the self-flux method, as described elsewhere . Many shining plate-like single crystals can be cleaved from the final products. <rs type="material" xml:id="x49">Cs x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> <rs type="tc">shows superconductivity</rs> at about <rs corresp="#x49" type="tcValue">30 K</rs>, and the actual composition determined by EDX is <rs type="material">Cs 0.86 Fe 1.66 Se 2</rs> . Two different types of <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> were obtained. The actual composition of the first one with <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x56" type="tcValue">32.6 K</rs> is <rs type="material" xml:id="x56">K 0.85 Fe 2 Se 1.80</rs> (denoted as <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1)</rs>. The actual composition of the second one with <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x60" type="tcValue">31.1 K</rs> is <rs type="material" xml:id="x60">K 0.86 Fe 2 Se 1.82</rs> (denoted as <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2)</rs>. Pressure was generated in a Teflon cup filled with Daphne Oil 7373, which was inserted into a Be-Cu pressure cell. The pressure was determined at low temperature by monitoring the shift in <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs> of pure tin. The <rs type="me_method">measurement of resistivity</rs> was carried out using Quantum Design PPMS-9.</p>
    <p>Figures 1(a)-(c) show the temperature dependence of the <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x64">in-plane resistivity</rs> for single <rs type="material">crystal Cs x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> , <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1</rs> and <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2</rs> under different pressures. <rs type="material" xml:id="x68">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1</rs> shows semiconducting behavior at high temperature, shows a broad hump at about 245 K under <rs corresp="#x70" type="pressure">ambient pressure</rs> and shows <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> at <rs corresp="#x64,#x68" type="tcValue" xml:id="x70">32.6 K</rs>. The <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x6-87">resistivity</rs> gradually decreases and the hump becomes much more obscure with increasing pressure. For <rs type="material" xml:id="x71">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2</rs>, the broad hump occurs at 130 K and <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> is <rs corresp="#x6-87,#x71" type="tcValue">31.1 K</rs>. For <rs type="material">Cs x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> , similar <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> behavior was observed with the broad hump centered at around 285 K. With increasing</p>

The dT c /dP ⇠ 1.3 K GPa 1 in the region of P &lt; 0.82 GPa is much less than that in <rs type="material">FeSe</rs> and almost the same as that observed in <rs type="material">electron-doped LaOFeAs</rs> . The pressure dependence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in <rs type="material">Cs x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> is quite similar to that of the <rs type="material">LaO 1 x F x FeAs</rs> system .</p>

    <p>b) for <rs type="material" xml:id="x105">Cs x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> . <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> decreases to <rs corresp="#x105" type="tcValue" xml:id="x107">29.8 K</rs> at the pressure of <rs corresp="#x107" type="pressure">1.64 GPa</rs>, which is about 2.8 K lower than the <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> at ambient pressure. The behavior of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> versus pressure for this compound is consistent with the results of Guo et al [26], whereas it is quite different from the results of Kawasaki et al [29]. Kawasaki et al reported that <rs type="tc">T onset c increases</rs> with increasing pressure, while <rs type="tc">T zero c decreases</rs>. This suggests that the <rs type="tc">superconducting transition</rs> broadens with increasing pressure. However, the <rs type="tc">superconducting transition</rs> width of <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1</rs> remains nearly unchanged with variation of pressure, as shown in figure 3(a). Such a difference could arise from the quality of the single crystal or the inhomogeneity of applied pressure . shows the temperature dependence of <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> of <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2</rs> under different pressures around the temperature range of <rs type="tc">superconducting transition</rs>. The <rs type="tc">T c</rs> at <rs type="pressure">ambient pressure</rs> is 1.5 K less than that of <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1</rs>.

        <p>a dome-like behavior, as shown in . It is similar to that observed in <rs type="material">single crystal Cs x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> . <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> gradually increases with increasing pressure and reaches the maximum value of <rs corresp="#x12-7,#x127" type="tcValue" xml:id="x130">32.7 K</rs> at the pressure of <rs corresp="#x130" type="pressure">0.48 GPa</rs> and then monotonically decreases with further increasing pressure. It should be noted that the <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1</rs> and <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2</rs> show different pressure dependences of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . Such a different pressure dependence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> indicates that there occurs optimal doping with the <rs type="tc">maximum T c</rs> ⇠ <rs corresp="#x138" type="tcValue">32.7 K</rs> in the <rs type="material" xml:id="x138">K x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> system. The pressure tends to destroy the magnetic transition in the undoped compounds and <rs type="tc">T c increases</rs> with increasing pressure for underdoped <rs type="class">iron-pnictides</rs> and monotonically decreases in the overdoped region. The different effects of pressure on <rs type="tc">T c</rs> between the <rs type="material">crystals K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1</rs> and <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2</rs> is easily understood because <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1</rs> is in the slightly overdoped range, while <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2</rs> is in the underdoped range. shows the pressure dependence of the <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> hump temperature for <rs type="material">Cs x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> , <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1</rs> and <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2</rs>. We defined the hump temperature when the resistivity reached its</p>
        <ab type="figureCaption">Pressure dependence of the resistivity hump temperature for <rs type="material">single crystals Cs x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> , <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1</rs> and <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2</rs>.</ab>
        <p>maximum value. The temperature of the hump monotonically increases with increasing pressure for all the samples. The shift of the resistivity hump temperature for <rs type="material">Cs x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> is very small below 0.82 GPa and increases apparently in the high pressure range. The temperature of the hump shows no direct connection with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> because the pressure dependence of hump temperature is quite different from that of <rs type="tc">T c</rs>. The hump in this kind of superconductor could arise from the content of K or the vacancy of Fe or Se sites.</p>
    <p>The normal state resistivity behavior and pressure dependence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> are quite different for the crystals <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> with different <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . The <rs type="tc">T c</rs> as a function of pressure for <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2</rs> shows a dome-like behavior and reaches its <rs type="tc">maximum T c</rs> at the pressure of <rs type="pressure">0.48 GPa</rs>. In contrast, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is gradually suppressed with increasing pressure for <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1</rs>. The pressure dependence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> for <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2</rs> and <rs type="material">Cs x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> is quite similar to that observed in the <rs type="material">LaO 1 x F x FeAs</rs> and parent <rs type="class">iron-pnictides</rs> . In contrast, for <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1</rs>, the pressure dependence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is similar to that observed in the overdoped <rs type="class">iron-pnictides</rs> . The <rs type="tc">maximum T c</rs> for the two batches of <rs type="material">single crystals K x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> is the same, and is reached at <rs type="pressure">ambient pressure</rs> and <rs type="pressure">0.48 GPa</rs>, respectively. The difference in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> between the two batches of <rs type="material">single crystal K x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> is very small (just 1.5 K), while the temperature of the resistivity hump is 245 and 130 K, respectively. This indicates that the hump temperature strongly depends on the sample. The hump behavior could originate from the vacancy of Fe or Se. Another piece of evidence is that the normal state resistivity is very high compared with other <rs type="class">iron-pnictide</rs> superconductors because the vacancy in conducting FeSe layers leads to a strong scattering and consequently high resistivity. This suggests that the physical behavior of <rs type="material">A x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> is very sensitive to the deficiency, and a change in the deficiency strongly affects the normal state resistivity although the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> does not change too much.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, we carried out the high-hydrostatic-pressure resistivity measurement for the newly discovered superconductors <rs type="material">A x Fe 2 Se 2 (A = K, Cs)</rs>. For <rs type="material">Cs x Fe 2 Se 2</rs> , <rs type="tc">T c</rs> starts to increase at a pressure <rs type="pressure">less than 0.82 GPa</rs>, and decreases with further increasing the pressure. This behavior is similar to that in <rs type="material">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2</rs>. In contrast, the behavior is quite different for <rs type="material" xml:id="x186">K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1</rs> with <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x186" type="tcValue">32.6 K</rs>, for which <rs type="tc">T c</rs> monotonically decreases with increasing pressure. The difference in pressure dependence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> between these single crystals is because they are at different doping levels with different <rs type="tc">T c</rs>. The temperature of the <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> hump increases with increasing pressure. The <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> hump could arise from the deficiency in Fe or Se in the conducting layers.</p>
