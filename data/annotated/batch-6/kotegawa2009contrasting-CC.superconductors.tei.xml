          <p>We report the <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> measurements under pressure of two <rs type="class">Fe-based</rs> superconductors with a thick perovskite oxide layer, <rs type="material">Sr2VFeAsO3</rs> and <rs type="material">Sr2ScFePO3</rs>. The <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs> <rs type="tc">Tc</rs> of <rs type="material" xml:id="x5">Sr2VFeAsO3</rs> markedly increases with increasing pressure. Its onset value, which was <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x5" type="tcValue">36.4 K</rs> at ambient pressure, increases to <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x5" type="tcValue" xml:id="x9">46.0 K</rs> at ∼ <rs corresp="#x9" type="pressure">4 GPa</rs>, ensuring the potential of the "<rs type="class">21113</rs>" system as a high-Tc material. However, the superconduc- tivity of <rs type="material" xml:id="x11">Sr2ScFePO3</rs> is strongly suppressed under pressure. The <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> of <rs corresp="#x11" type="tcValue">∼ 16 K</rs> decreases to ∼ <rs corresp="#x11" type="tcValue" xml:id="x14">5 K</rs> at ∼ <rs corresp="#x14" type="pressure">4 GPa</rs>, and the <rs type="tc">zero-resistance</rs> state is almost lost. We discuss the factor that induces this contrasting pressure effect.</p>

      <p>Intensive researches of the <rs type="class">Fe-based</rs> superconductors and related materials have continued to date. In these researches, one of interests is in the relationship between <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs> (<rs type="tc">T c</rs> ) and crys- tal structure. Lee et al. have found the relationship be- tween <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and the bond angle of As-Fe-As, and suggested that the formation of a regular FeAs 4 tetrahedron is im- portant for <rs type="tc">higher T c</rs> . 1) Meanwhile, Kuroki et al. have theoretically suggested that the pnictogen height from the Fe plane (h P n ) and lattice constant are good param- eters to control <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . 2) They pointed out that the nest- ing properties of Fermi surfaces are sensitive to h P n and, that the reduction in lattice constant suppresses superconductivity through the enhancement of the hop- ping between orbitals, and explained the difference in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> among some "<rs type="class">1111</rs>" systems such as <rs type="material">LaFeAs(O 1−x ,F x )</rs>, <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y</rs> , <rs type="material">LaFePO</rs>, and <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y</rs> under pres- sure. <rs type="material">FeSe</rs> ("<rs type="class">11</rs>" system) was also found to show a close relationship between <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and crystal structure, especially h P n . The <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs type="material" xml:id="x4-238">FeSe</rs>, which is <rs corresp="#x4-238" type="tcValue" xml:id="x31">8 K</rs> at <rs corresp="#x31" type="pressure">ambient pressure</rs>, increases markedly under pressure, accompanied by a decrease in h P n . The pressure dependence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ex- hibits a plateau at approximately 1 GPa. 7) h P n shows a similar pressure dependence to <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , and reproduces the plateau, while the bond angle of Se-Fe-Se is almost un- changed under pressure. 4) NMR studies of FeSe have re- vealed that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations develop under pressure associated with the increase in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . Results of these studies support that h P n is a key fac- tor for adjusting the nesting properties and <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . Between <rs type="material">LaFePO</rs> (h P n = 1.12Å) and <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y</rs> (h P n = 1.38 A), <rs type="tc">T c</rs> increases with increasing h P n , while the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs type="material">FeSe</rs> increases with decreasing h P n (h P n = 1.45 → 1.42 A). This suggests that an optimum h P n exists at ap- proximately h P n of <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y</rs>.</p>
      <p>Recently, a new series of <rs type="class">Fe-based</rs> superconductors with a thick perovskite oxide layer were discovered. 9, 10) * E-mail address: kotegawa@crystal.kobe-u.ac.jp</p>
      <p>Ogino et al. have reported a <rs type="tc">superconductivity of</rs> <rs corresp="#x44" type="tcValue">17 K</rs> in <rs type="material" xml:id="x44">Sr 2 ScFePO 3</rs> , which is the <rs type="tc">highest T c</rs> among those of <rs type="class">FeP systems</rs>. 9) On the other hand, Zhu et al. have re- ported a <rs type="tc">superconductivity of</rs> <rs corresp="#x49" type="tcValue">37 K</rs> in <rs type="material" xml:id="x49">Sr 2 VFeAsO 3</rs> . 10) These compounds have a highly two-dimensional crys- tal structure from which good nesting properties are ex- pected. Another feature related to crystal structure is that the distance between Fe and pnictogen, which is closely connected to h P n , tends to be longer than that of "<rs type="class">1111</rs>" systems. 11) Actually, the h P n of <rs type="material">Sr 2 ScFePO 3</rs> is estimated to be 1.20Å which is higher than that (1.12Å) of <rs type="material">LaFePO</rs>. In the case of <rs type="material">Sr 2 VFeAsO 3</rs> , h P n is esti- mated to be 1.42Å which is higher than that (1.38Å) of <rs type="material">NdFeAsO</rs> and close to that of <rs type="material">FeSe</rs> under pressure. In "<rs type="class">11</rs>" systems like <rs type="material">FeSe</rs>, there are no materials with a low h P n . However, "<rs type="class">21113</rs>" systems include materials with both high h P n and low h P n . It is expected that the pressure effect for these "<rs type="class">21113</rs>" systems will give a clue to understanding the crucial factor for <rs type="tc">higher T c</rs>.</p>
      <p>Polycrystalline samples were synthesized by solid-state reaction. 9) <rs type="material">Sr 2 ScFePO 3</rs> has a low bulk density of less than 40%. Electrical <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> (ρ) measurement at high pressures was carried out using an indenter cell. 12) Elec- trical <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> was measured by a four-probe method using silver paste for contact. The typical sample dimen- sions were 0.8 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm 3 . We used Daphne 7474 for the <rs xml:id="x10000" type="me_method">resistivity</rs> measurement as a pressure-transmitting medium. 13) Applied pressure was estimated from the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of the <rs type="material">lead</rs> manometer.</p>

The <rs type="tc">onset temperature of the superconducting transition</rs> (<rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> ) and the <rs type="tc">temperature of the zero re- sistance state</rs> (<rs type="tc">T zero c</rs> ) are defined in the figure.</p>

        <p>dence of ρ above <rs type="tc">T c</rs> approaches a T linear-like behavior from a T 2 -like behavior. The power n in ρ(T ) = ρ 0 +AT n between 50 and 100 K is tentatively estimated to be ∼ 1.8 at ambient pressure and ∼ 1.4 at 4.15 GPa while treating ρ 0 , A, and n as fitting parameters, although ρ 0 becomes negative above ∼ 2 GPa in this fitting. shows the pressure dependences of <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> and <rs type="tc">T zero c</rs> for <rs type="material">Sr 2 VFeAsO 3</rs> . <rs type="tc">T c</rs> first increases with a large slope of dT c /dP = 4.6 K/GPa, which seems to saturate</p>

The <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs type="material">Sr 2 VFeAsO 3</rs> under pressure exceeds those of "<rs type="class">122</rs>" systems such as <rs type="material">(Ba,K)Fe 2 As 2</rs> and <rs type="material">SrFe 2 As 2</rs> under pres- sure, but is lower than the <rs type="tc">highest T c</rs> of <rs type="tcValue">more than 50 K</rs> in "<rs type="class">1111</rs>" systems. Carrier density is also im- portant for the mechanism of superconductivity, but it is unknown whether the carrier density of <rs type="material">Sr 2 VFeAsO 3</rs> is optimum. If we can adjust carrier density, a <rs type="tc">higher T c</rs> might be realized in "<rs type="class">21113</rs>" systems.</p>

Figure (c) shows the ρ is measured for the different parts of the same sample. <rs type="tc">Tc decreases</rs> with increasing pressure, and the <rs type="tc">zero-resistance</rs> state <rs type="tc">disappears</rs> at high pressures.</ab>
      <p>a)-3(c) show the temperature dependences of ρ for <rs type="material" xml:id="x92">Sr 2 ScFePO 3</rs> at high pressures up to 4.17 GPa. At <rs corresp="#x95,#x97" type="pressure">ambient pressure</rs>, we estimated <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x92,#x11-164" type="tcValue" xml:id="x95">15.6 K</rs> and <rs type="tc">T zero c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x92,#x11-164" type="tcValue" xml:id="x97">8.4 K</rs>. This system exhibits a large supercon- ducting transition width probably owing to the low bulk density of the sample. We should note that a clear <rs xml:id="x10001" type="me_method">dia- magnetic signal</rs> is observed below <rs corresp="#x92,#x10000" type="tcValue" xml:id="x99">15 − 17 K</rs>. 9) The tran- sition width was large in run 1; it was sharp in run 2 using a different part of the same sample. Since the ab- solute value of ρ changed unnaturally in run 2, ρ is nor- malized at 20 K. As seen in the figure, the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of this compound decreases significantly under pressure, and the zero-<rs type="me_method" xml:id="x11-164">resistance</rs> state goes beyond the observed tempera- ture range above 4 GPa.</p>

      <p>shows the pressure dependences of <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> and <rs type="tc">T zero c</rs> for <rs type="material">Sr 2 ScFePO 3</rs> . <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> shows a large negative slope of −3.6 K/GPa at lower pressures and seems to sat- urate at high pressures. <rs type="tc">T zero c</rs> exhibits a strong sample- dependence, but approaches zero at approximately 4 GPa. The <rs type="tc">T c</rs> 's of <rs type="class">Fe-based</rs> superconductors have been pointed out to be associated with their crystal struc- tures. 1, 2) Lee et al. showed a clear relationship between <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and the bond angle of As-Fe-As in various <rs type="class">Fe-based</rs> su- perconductors, and suggested that a regular FeAs 4 tetra- hedron is important for a high <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . 1) However, although the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y</rs> decreases monotonically under pressure, the pressure dependence of the bond angle of As-Fe-As seems to be not associated with that of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . 19) Instead, Kuroki et al. have theoretically explained the re- duction in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> under pressure in <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y</rs> using the changes in h P n and lattice constant. 2) They have pointed out that the nesting property is sensitive to h P n . Also in <rs type="material">FeSe</rs>, the pressure dependence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> with a plateau at approximately 1 GPa is not associated with that of the bond angle of Se-Fe-Se but rather with that of h P n . The FeSe 4 tetrahedron slightly deviates from the regular one, but <rs type="tc">T c rapidly increases</rs>. 4) Thus, we consider that h P n is a good parameter for explaining the pressure de- pendence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs>.</p>
      <p>The <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , h P n , h P n under pressure, and the pressure ef- fects on <rs type="tc">T c</rs> for some <rs type="class">Fe-based</rs> superconductors are sum- marized in . The relationship between <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and h P n is seen at ambient pressure. implies that the h P n of <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y</rs> is optimum for a high <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . Kuroki et al., have suggested that lattice constant also affects <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs>, and its reduction lowers <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . Lattice constant, which always decreases under pressure, can- not be a factor for the increase in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> under pressure. Here, we take notice of h P n and its change under pres- sure while considering that an optimum h P n exists. Note that Kuroki et al. did not mention that an optimum h P n exists. The structural parameters under pressure for <rs type="material">FeSe</rs>, <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y</rs> , and <rs type="material">LiFeAs</rs> have already been in- vestigated. In <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y</rs> , h P n slightly decreases from 1.34 to 1.33Å under pressure. Note that this h P n at ambient pressure differs from that (1.38Å) reported by Lee et al. The decrease in h P n and the reduction in lattice constant are considered to suppress superconduc- tivity under pressure in <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y . 2</rs>) If we consider that the h P n = 1.34 − 1.38Å of <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y</rs> is the op- timum range for a high <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , the h P n of <rs type="material">FeSe</rs> approaches it under pressure, and <rs type="tc">T c</rs> increases. In contrast, the h P n of <rs type="material">LiFeAs</rs> deviates from the optimum range, and <rs type="tc">T c</rs> de- creases. In the case of <rs type="material">LiFeAs</rs>, a FeAs 4 tetrahedron also deviates from the regular one under pressure. The change in h P n is likely the main factor in deciding the change in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> under pressure in <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y</rs> , <rs type="material">FeSe,</rs> and <rs type="material">LiFeAs.</rs> In this context, if the h P n in "<rs type="class">21113"</rs> systems decreases under high pressures, the increase in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> under pressure for <rs type="material">Sr 2 VFeAsO 3</rs> is reasonable because the h P n is high at ambient pressure. Interestingly, the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and h P n of <rs type="material">Sr 2 VFeAsO 3</rs> are comparable to those of <rs type="material">FeSe</rs> under pressure. On the other hand, the decrease in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> under pressure for <rs type="material">Sr 2 ScFePO 3</rs> is also reasonable because the h P n at ambient pressure is already low.</p>
      <p>However, we should carefully study other factors that change under pressure, such as the carrier density and the magnetism of Fe or other magnetic ions, in dis- cussing <rs type="tc">T c</rs> under pressure. The pressure dependence of h P n also has to be determined experimentally. The <rs type="tc">T c</rs> 's of <rs type="material">LaFeAs(O 1−x F x )</rs> and <rs type="material">LaFePO</rs> increase under pres- sure. If the h P n of these compounds decreases under pressure as well as that of <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y</rs> , which is also a "<rs type="class">1111"</rs> system, the increase in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> cannot be explained. To our knowledge, there is as yet no report concerning the structural parameters of these compounds under pres- sure. It is interesting how the h P n 's of these compounds change under pressure. The pressure dependences of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> for <rs type="material">hole-doped K x Sr 1−x Fe 2 As 2</rs> systems have been inves- tigated. The <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of a lightly-doped system increases under pressure, while the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of a heavily-doped system decreases. It is doubtful whether these pressure effects can be explained by only the change in h P n .</p>
      <p>Another aspect that should be mentioned is the dif- ference in the band calculation between <rs type="material">Sr 2 VFeAsO 3</rs> and <rs type="material">Sr 2 ScFePO 3</rs> . Although the Sr 2 VO 3 layer in <rs type="material">Sr 2 VFeAsO 3</rs> is metallic, the Sr 2 ScO 3 layer is insulat- ing. The replacement of Sc with V is reported to lead to a drastic change in the Fermi surface. The ex- istence of the same nesting properties as those of other <rs type="class">Fe-based</rs> superconductors seems to be controversial in <rs type="material">Sr 2 VFeAsO 3</rs> . We may have to carefully determine whether the superconductivity in <rs type="material">Sr 2 VFeAsO 3</rs> is under- stood in the same framework as those in other <rs type="class">Fe-based</rs> superconductors.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have investigated the pressure effects of <rs type="material">Sr 2 VFeAsO 3</rs> and <rs type="material">Sr 2 ScFePO 3</rs> through <rs xml:id="x10002" type="me_method">resistivity</rs> mea- surement. The <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs type="material">Sr 2 VFeAsO 3</rs> significantly increases, while the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs type="material">Sr 2 ScFePO 3</rs> decreases under pressure. We conjecture that these opposite pressure effects mainly originate from the difference in h P n at ambient pressure. The <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> of <rs type="material" xml:id="x172">Sr 2 VFeAsO 3</rs> reaches <rs corresp="#x172,#x10002" type="tcValue" xml:id="x173">46 K</rs> at ∼ <rs corresp="#x173" type="pressure">4 GPa</rs>, and exceeds the <rs type="tc">maximum T c</rs> of "<rs type="class">122</rs>" and "<rs type="class">11"</rs> systems. The present results are expected to give a clue to obtaining a higher <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in "<rs type="class">21113"</rs> systems.</p>
      <ab type="tableCaption"><rs type="tc">Tc</rs>, h P n , h P n under pressure, and pressure effects on <rs type="tc">Tc</rs> (maximum <rs type="tc">T onset c</rs> under pressure) for some <rs type="class">Fe-based</rs> supercon- ductors. For <rs type="material">LiFeAs, FeSe</rs>, and <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y</rs> , the h P n 's under pressure have been determined. The relationship between <rs type="tc">Tc</rs> and h P n is observed at ambient pressure and under pressure, suggest- ing that the h P n range of 1.34 − 1.38Å of <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y</rs> is opti- mum for a high <rs type="tc">Tc</rs>. If h P n decreases under pressure in "<rs type="class">21113"</rs> systems, the pressure effects in <rs type="material">Sr 2 VFeAsO 3 and Sr 2 ScFePO 3</rs> are reasonable. <rs type="material">LaFeAs(O 1−x Fx)</rs> and <rs type="material">LaFePO</rs> may be excep- tions, if h P n decreases under pressure as well as <rs type="material">NdFeAsO 1−y</rs> . The pressure effect of <rs type="material">KxSr 1−x Fe 2 As 2</rs> may also be difficult to be explained by only the change in h P n . h P n is estimated to be 1.36 for x = 0 and 1.43 for x = 1 at ambient pressure.</ab>
