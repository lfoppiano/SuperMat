          <p>The thermal expansion coefficient α of <rs type="material">MgB2</rs> is revealed to change from positive to negative on cooling through the <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature Tc</rs>. The Grüneisen function also becomes negative at <rs type="tc">Tc</rs> followed by a dramatic increase to large positive values at low temperature. The results suggest anomalous coupling between superconducting electrons and low-energy phonons.</p>

      <p>Superconductivity in the binary compound <rs type="material" xml:id="x4">MgB 2</rs> near <rs corresp="#x4" type="tcValue">39 K</rs> is a fascinating development. Over the last few years, scientists have argued that a lattice instability and/or anomalous phonon behavior might be respon- sible for the <rs type="tc">high transition temperature</rs>. Specific atten- tion has focused on the E 2g phonon, a bond-stretching phonon within the plane of the hexagonal crystal struc- ture . In-plane tensile strain, induced by lat- tice mismatch through thin-film growth, <rs type="tc">increases the superconducting transition temperature T c</rs> to <rs corresp="#x4" type="tcValue">41.8 K;</rs> this enhancement was attributed to a decrease in the E 2g phonon frequency . Phonons can be studied with tech- niques such as Raman spectroscopy and heat ca- pacity . Often neglected in the study of phonons is thermal expansion, partly because of the exceptional resolution needed to resolve the transition at <rs type="tc">T c</rs>.</p>
      <p>Thermal expansion from powder diffraction measure- ments of <rs type="material">MgB 2</rs> have revealed an anomalous vol- ume expansion on cooling below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . However, high- resolution thermal expansion measurements (dilatome- try) with a relative sensitivity approximately four orders of magnitude better than powder diffraction are required for meaningful thermodynamic analysis. Such measure- ments of <rs type="material">polycrystalline MgB 2</rs> were reported , but discrepancies with the diffraction data, such as the tem- perature at which the thermal expansion coefficient α changes from positive to negative, are apparent.</p>
      <p>In this Letter, high-resolution thermal expansion mea- surements of <rs type="material">polycrystalline MgB 2</rs> are presented. The re- sults reveal a change in sign of α at <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , with negative ther- mal expansion below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ; these data agree with diffraction investigations , but offer exceedingly greater detail. Analysis of the bulk Grüneisen function reveals anoma- lous behavior due to dominant low-energy phonon modes. The change in sign of α at precisely <rs type="tc">T c</rs> suggests a connec- tion between these phonon modes and superconductivity.</p>
      <p><rs type="material">MgB 2</rs> , synthesized with 11 B as described previously , was pelletized (diameter = 4.6 mm), placed in a boron nitride crucible and heated to 800 • C for 30 min at 3 GPa using a cubic multi-anvil press. A very thin black layer, impurities from surface reaction with boron nitride, was removed, leaving behind a brilliant gold- colored <rs type="material">MgB 2</rs> sample with density 2.56 g/cm 3 (100% of theoretical density). <rs type="me_method">Heat capacity</rs> was measured with a thermal-relaxation technique. <rs type="tc">T c</rs> versus pressure was determined inductively (0.12 Oe rms field at 1023 Hz) to 0.63 GPa using a helium pressure medium; a manganin sensor at room temperature served as a manometer .</p>
      <p>Thermal expansion was measured with a novel capac- itive dilatometer cell () constructed from fused quartz , which has among the smallest known ther- mal expansions . Calibration is realized by measur- ing copper at 300 K and 79.3 K, where the length change of fused quartz, ∆L/L 300K , is zero . During measurements, the sample and cell (in thermal equilib- rium) are warmed at 0.2 K/min as capacitance and tem- perature are recorded at intervals ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 K. The data are corrected for temperature-dependent changes in capacitance of the empty cell, measured in a separate experiment, and the differential expansion of the cell/sample using data for quartz . These contribu- tions amount to 2.7 % and 4.1%, respectively, of the ca- pacitance change due to the thermal expansion of <rs type="material">MgB 2</rs> over the temperature range 6 K &lt; T &lt; 300 K; the lat- ter correction would be 63 times larger if a conventional copper dilatometer cell were used to measure <rs type="material" xml:id="x22">MgB 2</rs>, be- cause of copper's large thermal expansion . The spec- imen was measured along two perpendicular axes (4238 µm and 3665 µm long) to search for preferred crystallo- graphic orientation effects (none were detected).</p>
        <p>Linear thermal expansion ∆L/L 6K is shown in . These raw data have been corrected for the thermal expansion of quartz as described above with no other processing. The length decreases with temperature, as occurs in most materials, but it expands on cooling be- low <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x22" type="tcValue">38.7 K</rs> as illustrated in the inset where the 20 A scale reveals the absolute length change of the 4238 µm long specimen. The distinct change in ∆L/L 6K near <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is highlighted further in the inset of where angstrom-scale resolution and the continuous (second- order) nature of the phase transition are evident. The measurement was repeated 3 times along the 3665 µm length and 3 times along the 4238 µm length with simi- lar results to those shown in Figs. 2 and 3.</p>
      <ab type="figureCaption">Composed of two L-shaped pieces connected via 100 µm thick springs, all components of the dilatometer cell are made of fused quartz.

        <p>The thermal expansion coefficient α = (1/L 6K )∂∆L/∂T is obtained by fitting the data in using Chebyshev polynomials and differentiating; overlap between neighboring fit regions assures a smooth derivative and caution is exercised near the sharp feature at <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . This method is typical for taking derivatives when tiny changes between neighboring data points occurs . The resulting α values are plotted between 0 and 50 K in ; all six measurement showed similar behavior. Note that α(50 K) is 16.7 times smaller than that of copper , a consequence of the large Debye temperature of <rs type="material">MgB 2</rs>. Negative thermal expansion sets in at precisely <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and further inspection reveals a crossover at 18.7 K to α &gt; 0. Furthermore, a broad peak is evident in α at 9.7 K, below which it decreases. According to the third law of thermodynamics, α should approach zero at T = 0; this behavior is illustrated by the (hypothetical) dashed line in .</p>
      <ab type="figureCaption">Inset shows ∆L/L6K near <rs type="tc">Tc</rs> illustrating the change in slope, excellent resolution of the data, and continuous na- ture of the phase transition. The solid line in the inset is the fit that, after differentiation, yields the thermal expansion co- efficient α (main panel). Solid lines indicate the jump in α at <rs type="tc">Tc</rs>. The dashed line below 6 K denotes hypothetical behavior.</ab>
        <p>The jump in α at <rs type="tc">T c</rs> (solid lines ), ∆α = α N- α S = 6.3(7)x10 −8 K −1 ,was obtained after averaging the jumps observed in six measurements; N represents the normal state and S the superconducting state. This value agrees with ∆α = 5.8x10 −8 K −1 reported previously ; in that report, α &lt; 0 below 10 K, but remained above zero for T &gt; 10 K. These differences may be associated with: (1) the high density of our specimen, since <rs type="material" xml:id="x30">poly- crystalline MgB 2</rs> prepared by the method in Ref.is highly porous with low cohesiveness and elastic modulus , (2) the <rs type="tc">higher T c</rs> (<rs corresp="#x30" type="tcValue">38.7 K</rs> vs. <rs corresp="#x30" type="tcValue">37.8 K</rs>), or (3) the copper thermal expansion cell used in Ref. which requires a significantly larger correction to the data than our cell (see above). Behavior in ∆L/L 6K similar to that of was revealed in diffraction measurements , but the present data offer far more detail.</p>
        <ab type="figureCaption">The main panel and upper inset show the bulk Grüeneisen function γG versus temperature. The lower in- set shows <rs type="me_method">heat capacity</rs> CP after subtraction of CP (9 tesla); the solid line indicates the jump expected for a continuous (second-order) phase transition.</ab>
      <p><rs type="me_method">Heat capacity</rs> at constant pressure C P was measured on the same sample. A background of the form C P = A 1 T + A 3 T 3 + A 5 T 5 (A 1 , A 3 , and A 5 are constants) is subtracted, which was obtained by fitting C P (9 tesla) in the range 25 K &lt; T &lt; 50 K; the form of this back- ground is identical to that used previously . A clear feature is observed at <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x30" type="tcValue">38.7 K</rs> (lower inset of . The solid lines denote the step-like behavior expected for a continuous (second-order) phase transition. Using an entropy-conserving construction, the jump ∆C P = -121(1) mJ/mole K is estimated. The Ehrenfest relation provides the connection between the pressure derivative of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , ∆α, and ∆C P (v is the molar volume). It has yielded dT c /dP in agreement with experiment for other superconductors . Using ∆α = 6.3(7)x10 −8 K −1 , ∆C P = -121(1) mJ/mole K, and v = 1.74x10 −5 m 3 /mole , dT c /dP = -1.05(13) K/GPa is obtained. Variation in ∆C P values (66 mJ/mole K to 133 mJ/mole K) underscores the importance of measuring ∆C P and ∆α on the same sample to reliably estimate dT c /dP . To test the calculation via Eq. (1), dT c /dP was mea- sured on our sample using a purely hydrostatic method. Pressure was changed below 55 K and only one tran- sition (P = 0.63 GPa) was measured in solid helium. <rs type="tc">T c</rs> (P ) was determined from the <rs type="me_method">midpoint of the super- conducting transition</rs> in the real part of the ac <rs type="me_method">magnetic susceptibility</rs>. The data show that <rs type="tc">T c decreases</rs> at dT c /dP = -1.07(0.03) K/GPa, similar to prior reports . This value is in excellent agreement with the value predicted by the Ehrenfest relation. This observation together with the continuous behavior of ∆L/L 6K elim- inates the possibility of a significant lattice instability in <rs type="material">MgB 2</rs> for 6 K &lt; T &lt; 300 K.</p>
      <p>While negative thermal expansivities are not that un- usual , the crossover of α from positive to negative, at precisely <rs type="tc">T c</rs>, is rare. <rs type="material" xml:id="x14-27">Tantalum</rs> exhibits a slight neg- ative α below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x14-27,#x45" type="tcValue">4.4 K</rs>; what distinguishes this feature in <rs type="material">MgB 2</rs> is that α is eight times larger above <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , and that it becomes strongly negative below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . Thus, the electronic transition into the <rs type="tc">superconducting state</rs> has a significant impact on the thermal expansion at and below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> as revealed in Figs. 2-3.</p>
      <ab type="figureCaption">In the inset <rs type="tc">Tc</rs> versus pressure is plotted. These data were determined from the midpoint of the transition in the ac <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x45">magnetic susceptibility</rs> χac, shown in the main panel.</ab>
        <p>Thermal expansion is a sensitive probe of phonon be- havior which is analyzed through the bulk Grüneisen function γ G = βBV /C V calculated using data for the bulk modulus B and our measurements of the vol- ume thermal expansion coefficient β = 3α, V and C P (the <rs type="me_method">heat capacity</rs> at constant volume C V ≈ C P ). It is a dimensionless weighted sum of γ i values (i.e., γ G = i c i γ i / i c i ) each associated with a phonon mode of vibrational frequency ω i and γ i = −dlnω i /dlnV . γ G has a value of 1.30 near 300 K, rises slightly to 1.35 at 90 K followed by a gradual decrease. This decrease con- tinues (see ), until γ G crosses zero at <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , reaches a minimum of -1.65 at 24.5 K, before increasing to 34.2 at 5.8 K. Nonmonotonic behavior of the Grüneisen function is a consequence of strong anharmonic lattice vibrations , which have been observed in <rs type="material">MgB 2</rs>. The neg- ative as well as the large positive values of γ G must be associated with anomalous phonon modes that dominate the weighted sum due to their respective thermal popu- lations; electron-phonon interactions will also play a role.</p>
      <p>In other layered materials, negative α values are gener- ally associated with transverse acoustic vibrations, which propagate in the layers , leading to negative a-axis γ i values. As a result, the change in sign of α and γ G at <rs type="tc">T c</rs>, coincident with hardening of the E 2g phonon , is likely connected to planar electron-phonon interactions associated with the σ-band (in-plane) superconducting gap .</p>
      <p>At low temperature, differences in the intralayer bond- ing (along the c-axis) may lead to low-energy phonon excitations and large c-axis γ i values with high relative thermal population that cause the upturn of γ G below 20 K; such behavior occurs in other layered materials, albeit with significantly smaller values of γ G . In <rs type="material">MgB 2</rs>, the spectacular increase of γ G coincides with a reduced C P below ≈ 11 K, attributed to a second superconducting gap . Thus, C P is diminished because of electronic effects due to the second gap, α remains large, and their ratio leads to anomalously large γ G values. These com- bined considerations suggest that the increase in γ G at low temperature may result from out-of-plane electron- phonon interactions, associated with the weaker π-band superconducting gap , which have a strong impact on the c-axis γ i values.</p>
      <p>The results presented here compliment spectroscopic phonon probes, some of which may be surface sensitive, by illustrating unusual phonon behavior in two funda- mental bulk thermodynamic quantities, the Grüneisen function and the thermal expansion coefficient. Thermal excitations of electrons across the two superconducting gaps, and their coupling to low-energy lattice vibrations, play a role in the anomalous behavior of γ G and α.</p>
