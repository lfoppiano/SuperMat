          <p>We report <rs type="me_method">electrical resistance</rs> and magnetoresistance measurements on <rs type="material">EuBa2(Cu 1 yZnv)30 x</rs> under pressures to <rs type="pressure">17kbar</rs>. With Zn substitution, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is depressed rapidly (-19K/at.%Zn) and there are qualitative changes in the temperature and field response of the <rs type="me_method">resistance</rs>. Pressure drives the Zn-substituted samples toward undoped <rs type="material">EuBa2Cu30</rs> ~ behavior. Analysis of the temperature dependent <rs type="me_method">resistance</rs> for <rs type="material">y =0.05</rs> and P = 0, together with Hall effect and thermopower data, suggests that the suppression of superconductivity may arise from weak three-dimensional localization promoted by Coulomb interactions.</p>

      <p>Understanding the mechanism for high super- conducting <rs type="tc">transition temperatures T c</rs> in the <rs type="class">oxide</rs> compounds <rs type="material">RBa2Cu30 x</rs> is among top- ics most actively pursued currently. The observa- tion of virtual independence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> when R is a rare earth highlighted the importance of the Cu-O planes/chains for superconductivity. Re- cent studies of the oxygen content and 3d element substitution for Cu have reinforced this viewpoint. However, there is still no consen- sus on the actual processes leading to supercon- ducting pair formation and condensation.</p>
      <p>We have studied the influence of small amounts of Zn in <rs type="material">EuBa2(CUl_yZny)3Ox, where y = 1, 3.5 and 5 at. %</rs>, through <rs type="me_method">electrical resistivi- ty</rs> and magnetoresistance under pressures P&lt; 17 kbar and Hall effect and thermopower mea- surements using conventional ac and/or dc tech- niques. As shown in the <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs> is depressed by Zn substi- tution at a rate dTJdy =-19 K/at.%, which is over five times larger than for Cr and Mn doping and nearly three times larger than for Ni .</p>
      <p>Because Zn has a full 3d shell, this depression clearly is not related to magnetic pair-breaking effects.</p>
      <p>In we show the <rs type="me_method">resistance</rs> R of <rs type="material">EuBa2 (Cu0.99Zn0.01)30 x</rs> at four different pressures as a function of temperature. In con- trast to <rs type="me_method">R(T)</rs> for <rs type="material">EuBa2Cu3Ox</rs>, which is linear in T from above T~ to room temperature, the <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x7-92">resist- ance</rs> for <rs type="material" xml:id="x27">x = 0.01</rs> varies non-monotonically with decreasing temperature, reaching a maximum near 80K before dropping to zero at <rs corresp="#x7-92,#x27" type="tcValue">~45 K</rs>. With increasing pressure, the region of linear <rs type="me_method">resistance</rs> extends to lower temperatures, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in- creases, AT~ (10-90%) sharpens, and at the highest pressures the maximum in <rs type="me_method">R</rs> disappears. The inset of shows that dTjdP is almost ten times larger for <rs type="material">x = 0.01</rs> than for <rs type="material">x = 0</rs> and for other RBa2C%O ~ samples previously studied .</p>

      <p>For x = 0.05 (fig. 3), the zero pressure resist- ance increases monotonically with decreasing temperature, and there is no sign of supercon- ductivity above <rs type="tcValue">4 K</rs>. (Results for <rs type="material">x = 0.035</rs>, not shown, are intermediate between <rs type="material">x = 0.01 and 0.05</rs> both at ambient and elevated pressures.) With pressure the low temperature resistance upturn is suppressed and a maximum appears near <rs type="tcValue">10 K</rs> <rs type="pressure">under 16.1 kbar</rs>, possibly signaling the appearance of a <rs type="tc">superconducting transition</rs>. The application of an 8 T magnetic field H (see fig. 4) restores the resistance of its temperature de- pendence in zero field for P_-&lt; ll.6kbar. After cooling the sample in zero field, measurements upon warming to 20 K were taken in the sequence: (9 (open circles with dot), 8, 7, 6, 5, 0.5, 0.05, and 0 T. After the last H = 0 run, the sample was warmed to 40 K, then cooled and rerun in zero field (squares). on the magnetic and thermal history of the sam- ple. Magnetoresistance curves obtained in a simi- lar manner for P = 11.6 kbar resemble those in for H &gt; 0.05 T, while for P = 0 the resist- ance changes by less than 0.5% under an 8T field at all temperatures T &lt; 300 K, as is also the case for undoped <rs type="material">EuBa2Cu30 x</rs>.</p>
      <p>In an earlier study of 3d element substitutions for Cu in <rs type="material">YBa2(Cu0.09A0.i)306+a</rs>, Xiao noted, on the basis of a moderate <rs type="me_method">resistance</rs> upturn for T &gt; To, that the conduction electrons appeared to become weakly localized before superconductivity set in and that this was most pronounced for Zn. The inset of shows a plot of electrical conductance versus T 2/3. The linear variation, 1/R~ T 2/3, found for 4&lt; T&lt; 120 K, is consistent with the power law depend- ence expected for weak three-dimensional localization. If the observed behavior is due to localization, it arises from more than simple disorder because 5% Cr or Mn substitutions, while causing a <rs type="me_method">resistance</rs> upturn at low tempera- tures before the <rs type="tc">onset of superconductivity</rs>, do not have such a dramatic effect.</p>
      <p>Both the thermopower and Hall coefficient, positive for y = 0, remain positive but change substantially, by factors of nine and three respec- tively, upon substituting 5 at.% Zn, indicative of strong modifications to the Fermi surface charac- ter. Previously we have argued for the pres- ence of strong Coulomb correlations in <rs type="material">YBa2Cu30 x</rs>. The data of figs. 1-4 might suggest that Coulomb effects become increasingly impor- tant with Zn doping. Reasoning for a plausible argument is as follows: Because Zn has a full d-band, substitution of Zn reduces the d-density- of-states at Ev, believed to be important for superconductivity , and consequently inhibits conduction screening of Coulomb interactions. The enhanced Coulomb effects in turn promote localization at the expense of superconductivity. On the other hand, pressure favors superconduc-tivity as shown in . These arguments are consistent with a large body of data, in addition to those presented here, on the Cu-O supercon- ductors.</p>
      <p>In summary, Zn substitution for Cu in <rs type="material">EuBa2(Cu 1 yZny)30 x</rs> results in a strong depres- sion of superconductivity that may arise from Coulomb-correlation assisted localization. The application of pressure tends to drive y &gt; 0 sam- ples towards behaviors found in undoped <rs type="material">EuBa2Cu30 x</rs>.</p>
