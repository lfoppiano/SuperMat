          <p>The high magnetic field phase diagram of the electron-doped infinite layer high-temperature superconducting (high-<rs type="tc">Tc</rs>) compound <rs type="material">Sr0.9La0.1CuO2</rs> was probed by means of penetration depth and <rs type="me_method">magnetization measurements</rs> in pulsed fields to 60 T. An anisotropy ratio of 8 was detected for the upper critical fields with H parallel (H ab c2 ) and perpendicular (H c c2 ) to the CuO2 planes, with H ab c2 extrapolating to near the Pauli paramagnetic limit of 160 T. The longer superconducting coherence length than the lattice constant along the c-axis indicates that the orbital degrees of freedom of the pairing wavefunction are three dimensional. By contrast, <rs type="me_method">low-field magnetization</rs> and <rs type="me_method">specific heat measurements</rs> of <rs type="material">Sr0.9Gd0.1CuO2</rs> indicate a coexistence of bulk s-wave <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> with large moment Gd paramagnetism close to the CuO2 planes, suggesting a strong confinement of the spin degrees of freedom of the Cooper pair to the CuO2 planes. The region between H ab c2 and the irreversibility line in the magnetization, H ab irr , is anomalously large for an electron-doped high-<rs type="tc">Tc</rs> <rs type="class">cuprate</rs>, suggesting the existence of additional quantum fluctuations perhaps due to a competing spin-density wave order.</p>

    <p>In the high-<rs type="tc">T c</rs> <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductors, anisotropy has been suggested to play an important role in the super- conducting pairing mechanism and the elevated <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in both experimental and theoretical work . It is surprising therefore to find <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> (<rs type="tc">SC</rs>) with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x13" type="tcValue">43 K</rs> in the optimal <rs type="class">electron-doped infinite-layer cuprates</rs> <rs type="material" xml:id="x13">Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2 (M = La, Gd)</rs>, which exhibit only a 16% difference between the a and c tetragonal lattice parameters. The structure of <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2</rs> is the most basic among all high-<rs type="tc">T c</rs> <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>, consisting entirely of CuO 2 sheets separated by rare-earth (RE) ions with tetragonal lattice parameters c = 3.41Å and a = 3.95Å.The recent success in producing high-quality polycrystalline samples of the <rs type="class">infinite-layer cuprates</rs> with no observable impurity phases has en- gendered a renewed interest in these compounds. X-ray near-edge absorption spectroscopy indicate electron dop- ing, and <rs type="tc">bulk SC</rs> has been verified by <rs type="me_method">powdered mag- netization</rs> (M ) measurements and <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> (C) measurements (data presented later in this work). Sev- eral recent studies of these high purity polycrystalline samples suggest three-dimensional (3D) superconductiv- ity in <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> . Scanning tunnel spectroscopy (STS) measurements indicate an unconventional but isotropic s-wave superconducting gap with no pseudogap at zero field. The s-wave symmetry of the gap is also sup- ported by <rs type="me_method">specific heat measurements</rs> and Cu-site substi- tution studies,although it may be contradicted by NMR measurements.Kim et al estimated the c-axis coherence length (ξ c ) from a Hao-Clem analysis of the reversible <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> of grain-aligned poly- crystal, and found that ξ c exceeds the spacing between the CuO 2 planes, indicating 3D superconductivity. On the other hand, they also find significant anisotropy be-tween magnetic fields H ≤ 5 T oriented parallel and per- pendicular to the CuO 2 planes, with an anisotropy ratio γ = ξ c /ξ ab = H ab c2 /H c c2 = 9.3, which is larger than γ = 5 observed in <rs type="material">YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ</rs> although much smaller than γ = 55 observed in <rs type="material">optimally doped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8−δ</rs> . It is interesting to note that the only ma- jor crystallographic difference between the a-b and the c directions in <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> is the presence of oxygen in the a-b plane, which allows coupling of adjacent Cu spins and has been implicated as the cause of antiferro- magntic ordering or spin fluctuations in other members of the high-<rs type="tc">T c</rs> <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> family, as well as a possible mech- anism for superconducting pairing. The importance of the CuO 2 planes to the <rs type="tc">SC</rs> in <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2</rs> is further supported by the fact that Ni substitution on the Cu site rapidly suppresses <rs type="tc">T c</rs> whereas out-of-plane Gd substitu- tion on the Sr site leaves <rs type="tc">T c</rs> unchanged. In this work we determine the upper critical field H c2 and the irreversibility field H irr of <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> by means of <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> and penetration depth measure- ments in pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T in order to directly investigate the degree of upper critical field anisotropy and the role of vortex fluctuations. We also present <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> (C) and <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> (M ) mea- surements in low DC fields to 6 T as a function of tem- perature (T ) of <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 Gd 0.1 CuO 2</rs>, confirming the bulk co- existence of Gd paramagnetism (PM) and <rs type="tc">SC</rs>. Our re- sults suggest strong confinement of the spin pairing wave function to the CuO 2 planes and significant field-induced superconducting fluctuations.</p>
    <p>Noncrystalline samples of <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> and <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 Gd 0.1 CuO 2</rs> were prepared under high pressures as described previously. <rs type="me_method">Magnetization measurements</rs> in pulsed magnetic fields were performed at the National</p>

High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Los Alamos, NM in a 3 He refrigerator in a 50 T magnet using a compensated coil. The sample consisted of four pieces of <rs type="material">polycrystalline Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> with a total mass of 4.8 mg to maximize signal and minimize heating. The irreversibility field H irr was identified from the onset of reversibility in the M (H) loops. The penetration depth of <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> was determined by measuring the frequency shift ∆f of a tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) resonant tank circuit with the sample contained in one of the component inductors. A ten turn 0.7 mm diameter aluminum coil was tightly wound around the sample with a filling factor of greater than 90%, with the coil axis oriented perpendicular to the pulsed field. To maintain temperature stability, the sample was thermally anchored to a sapphire plate and placed in 3 He exchange gas. Small changes in the resonant frequency can be related to changes in the penetration depth ∆λ by ∆λ = − R 2 rs ∆f f0 , where R is the radius of the coil and r s is the radius of the sample. In our case, R ∼ r s = 0.7 mm and the reference frequency f 0 ∼ 60 MHz such that ∆f = (0.16 MHz/µm)∆λ.</p>
        <p>The frequency shift ∆f relative to the normal state and the corresponding ∆λ of <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> are shown in as a function of H. The inset shows the T -dependence of ∆f in zero magnetic field. The nor- mal state resonant frequency f that is reached with in- creasing field can only be determined for T ≥ 30 K; for lower T the sample remains superconducting to 60 T so ∆f is estimated. The frequency shift of the empty coil has been subtracted from all data. In applied fields, the <rs type="tc">SC transition</rs> is very broad, which can be attributed to the large anisotropy in H c2 of the randomly orientated grains in the polycrystal.By contrast, the <rs type="tc">SC tran- sition</rs> as a function of T at H = 0 is very sharp, in- dicating a high quality sample. Therefore, the onset of diamagnetism with decreasing H in the λ(H) data can be identified with the largest H c2 , H ab c2 for fields in the CuO 2 planes. The onset is defined as H where ∆f &gt; 5 kHz (∆λ &gt; 30 nm), just above the noise of the exper- iment. Different onset criteria have only minor effects on the determination of H ab c2 , as shown in where H ab c2 using an onset criteria of 10 kHz and 20 kHz are shown as open circles and diamonds, respectively. The upper critical field H ab c2 is linear in T up to the H = 60 T maximum of the experiment, and extrapolates to 153 T at zero temperature. (Although if we assume the typ- ical Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg curvature for an or- bitally limited superconductor, 153 T would consti- tute an upper limit for H ab c2 ). The linearly extrapolated value of 153 T is close to the s-wave Pauli paramagnetic limit of H p c2 = ∆ √ 2µB = 159 T, where ∆ = 13 meV has been determined independently from STS data. This raises the possibility of spin-limited superconduc- tivity for H in the plane, which has also been observed in <rs type="material">YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ</rs>.Determination of the critical fields for H along the c- axis, H c c2 , from these data on noncrystalline samples is more difficult. However, at fields below the onset of dia- magnetism we do observe a significant change in slope of the λ(H) data, indicated as H kink in . The H kink vs T curve is shown in and extrapolates to 12 T at zero temperature. This value of H kink (T = 0) is close to H c c2 = 14 T determined from a Hao-Clem analysis men- tioned previously. [5] We therefore associate H kink with H c c2 . In λ(H) measurements of a noncrystalline sample, a change in slope near H c c2 could be expected since the number of grains in the polycrystal that are supercon- ducting varies with H for H c c2 &lt; H &lt; H ab c2 , whereas for H &lt; H c c2 the entire sample is superconducting, yield- ing different H dependencies of the flux expulsion in these two regions. Our data yield an anisotropy ratio γ = dH ab c2 dT / H c c2 dT ∼ 8, roughly in agreement with γ = 9.3 determined from low field studies. In penetration depth measurements of single crys- talline organic superconductors for H along the conduct- ing planes, a kink below H c2 for fields has been asso- ciated with the vortex melting transition.However, in this work we have determined the vortex dynamics separately by means of <rs type="me_method">magnetization measurements</rs> in pulsed fields, and we find a significant difference be- tween the onset of irreversibility in M (H), H irr , and H kink as shown in . Following similar arguments for the λ(H) measurements, we note that H ab irr &gt; H c irr in <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductors, therefore we assign the on- set of irreversibility for <rs type="material">polycrystalline Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> to H ab irr . Although we can't rule out the possibility that H kink might be associated with a vortex phase trans- formation, the fact that H kink (T → 0) saturates, and H kink (T → 0) &lt;&lt; H ab c2 (T → 0) indicates that H kink (T ) is unlikely caused by a thermally-induced vortex melt- ing transition for H||ab. Future pulsed-field measure- ments on grain-aligned or epitaxial thin film samples will be necessary to conclusively determine whether H kink (T ) obtained in this work may be identified with H c c2 (T ). The region between H ab irr and H ab c2 in the phase dia- gram in is significantly larger than is observed in other electron-doped high-<rs type="tc">T c</rs> compounds where H c2 typically tracks H irr . It is particularly surpris- ing that H ab irr (T → 0) ∼ 45 T is much smaller than H ab c2 (T → 0) ∼ 150 T. In <rs type="class">hole-doped cuprates</rs>, a large separation between H irr and H c2 is often observed and is generally referred to as a vortex-liquid phase due to thermally induced fluctuations. The large discrepancy between H ab irr and H ab c2 in <rs type="material">e-doped Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> even to T → 0 suggests the presence of field-enhanced SC fluc- tuations in <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> . Enhanced SC fluctuations down to very low T may be consistent with a scenario of SC coexisting with a competing order, such as a spin- density wave (SDW) near a quantum critical point. In particular, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations associ- ated with the competing SDW can be enhanced by ex- ternal fields. The conjecture of a competing order in the SC state of <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> is also consistent with our recent STS studies, where we observe the emergence of a second energy gap with increasing tunnelling current upon the closing of the SC gap. In con- trast to the SC gap, the current-induced gap is not spa- tially uniform probably due to interactions of the SDW with charge disorder. We note that experimental evidence for coexistence of a SDW with <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> super- conductivity has been found in other high-<rs type="tc">T c</rs> compounds. To further investigate the dimensionality of the super-conductivity, low-field C(T ) and M (T, H) of <rs type="material" xml:id="x55">polycrys- talline Sr 0.9 Gd 0.1 CuO 2</rs> were measured with H up to 6 T and T down to 1.8 K in a Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System and a SQUID magne- tometer, respectively. In contrast to in-plane Ni substi- tution on the Cu site, out of plane Gd substitution on the Sr site <rs type="tc">does not suppress T c</rs> . In fact, the Gd ions exhibit local moment paramagnetism (PM) that coexists with <rs type="tc">SC</rs> to low T . shows M (H) at T = 5 K, and zero field/field cooled magnetization curves as a function of T in the inset. The M (H) curve in the main figure can be viewed as a superposition of a SC hysteresis curve and a Brillouin function resulting from the PM of Gd. Further proof for this coexistence is evident in the inset, which shows a large positive magnetization asso- ciated with Gd paramagnetism, but nevertheless signifi- cant hysteresis between zero-field-cooled and field-cooled curves, indicating <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs>.</p>

    <p>In , the magnitude of the paramagnetic contri- bution from the Gd ions is investigated quantitatively. The main figure shows C(T ) at H = 0 and H = 6 T. The H = 0 data is fit by a T 3 dependence to model the phonon contribution, (the electronic contribution at these temperature can be neglected). For H = 6 T, C(T ) can be fit by the same T 3 dependence as the H = 0 data, plus an additional contribution from the Gd paramag- netic moments, derived from mean field theory assuming the Hund's rule J = 7/2 moment, and one Gd ion for every ten unit cells. The fit is remarkable, considering that there are no fitting parameters. In the upper inset of , 1/χ is plotted as function of T , where the line is a Curie-Weiss fit with µ eff = 8.2µ B , which is close to the Hund's rule moment of 7.6 µ B and the typically ob- served Gd moment of 8 µ B . Thus we can conclude that all of the Gd ions in the sample are paramagnetic and coexist with <rs type="tc">SC</rs> down to 1.8 K, despite the close prox- imity of the Gd ions to the CuO 2 planes (1.7Å). This is evidence for a strong confinement of the superconduct- ing singlet spin pair wave function to the CuO 2 planes. On the other hand, the c-axis superconducting coherence</p>

The notion of 3D SC is corroborated by our STS studies, which probe the charge degrees of freedom and reveal an isotropic s-wave superconducting gap. The apparent problem of 3D isotropic s-wave SC coexisting with strong Gd local moments less than 1.7Å from the CuO 2 planes can be resolved by considering the spin and charge (orbital) de- grees of freedom of the Cooper pairs separately. Whereas the singlet spin pairing is confined to the CuO 2 planes, the orbital pair wave function could still overlap adjacent CuO 2 planes, resulting in 3D SC for all values of T &lt; <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and H &lt; H c2 . The bulk nature of the SC is evident in the lower inset of , which shows the electronic con- tribution to C plotted as ∆C/T vs T . The peak near <rs type="tcValue">43 K</rs> is associated with <rs type="tc">T c</rs>, and the ratio ∆C/γT c is 2.9, assuming a Sommerfeld coefficient of γ = 1.2 mJ/mol K 2 .</ab>
    <p>In conclusion, a large upper critical field anisotropy ra- tio γ = 8 has been inferred from penetration depth mea- surements of <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> in pulsed fields, despite the nearly cubic crystal structure. The in plane upper criti- cal field H ab c2 extrapolates close to the Pauli paramagnetic limit H P c2 = 159 T, suggesting possible spin limiting for this orientation, as has been observed in <rs type="material">YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ</rs> . There is a large separation between H ab c2 and the irre- versibility field H ab irr , which extends down to T → 0, and is abnormal for electron doped high-<rs type="tc">T c</rs> <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>. This suggests the existence of field-induced superconducting spin fluctuations perhaps due to a competing SDW. In spite of the significant anisotropy in the upper critical fields, ξ c is longer than the spacing between CuO 2 planes, indicating three-dimensionality of the orbital wave func- tion. The low-field thermodynamic measurements of <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x67">M (T )</rs> and <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x68">C(T )</rs> for <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 Gd 0.1 CuO 2</rs> polycrystals indi- cate a coexistence of bulk <rs type="tc">SC</rs> with Gd paramagnetism, with the full J = 7/2 Hund's rule moment despite the close proximity of Gd atoms to the CuO 2 planes, and a <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs corresp="#x67,#x68,#x72,#x73" type="tcValue">43 K</rs> in both <rs type="material" xml:id="x72">Sr 0.9 Gd 0.1 CuO 2</rs> and <rs type="material" xml:id="x73">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs>. This can interpreted in terms of a strong confinement of the spin degrees of freedom of the Cooper pairs to the CuO 2 planes, whereas the orbital wave functions over- lap adjacent CuO 2 planes, and exhibit isotropic s-wave symmetry as determined by STS measurements.</p>
