        <p>One of the central issues of solid state physics in re- cent decades has been the physics of electron-electron (e-e) correlation. As a hallmark of the Fermi liquid state formed by strong electron correlations, the resistivity ex- hibits T 2 dependence at low temperatures, as in many heavy-fermion systems . T 2 dependence of <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x4-64">resistivity</rs> also appears in quasi-2-dimensional Fermi liquid of ox- ides such as <rs type="material" xml:id="x6">Sr 2 RuO 4</rs> 2 , which is strongly suggested as a spin-triplet superconductor with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x4-64,#x6" type="tcValue">1.5 K.</rs> Interest- ingly, a <rs type="material" xml:id="x9">layered compound MgB 2</rs> , which <rs type="tc">shows super- conductivity</rs> at <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x9,#x4-130" type="tcValue">39 K</rs> 3 , also exhibits T 2 depen- dence in the <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x4-130">resistivity</rs> up to 240 K 4,5 . The ρ ∝ T 2 law in <rs type="material">MgB 2</rs> is attributed not to the e-e correlation, but to the strong electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling be- tween a quasi-2-dimensional conduction band and an op- tic phonon mode in the boron honeycomb layer 6 .</p>
        <p>As another example of a layered system which exhibits T 2 resistivity, but in a much wider temperature range up to room temperature, we report here the physical proper- ties of a <rs type="material">layered oxide Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> . This material was first reported by A. Byström and L. Evers in 1950 7 . As shown in , the crystal structure consists of an alternat- ing stacking of Kagome layers of silver and honeycomb- like networks of PbO 6 octahedra, which is connected by one-dimensional chains of silver penetrating the layers. As a whole, <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> forms a hexagonal P31m struc- ture with lattice parameters a = b = 5.9324(3)Å and c = 6.4105(4)Å 8 .</p>
        <p>Far before the report of the ρ ∝ T 2 law, it was suggested by B. Dickens that <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> shows metal- lic conductivity 9 , and it was confirmed by M. Jansen et al. in polycrystalline samples 8 . Band calculation by T. D. Brennan et al. revealed that its Fermi level is located near the center of the band and that its con- ductivity is attributed to one free electron from one formula unit, de-localized to all over the silver sub- structure; thus its valence formula is represented as (Ag 5 ) 4+ (Pb 4+ ) 2 (O 2− ) 6 . The T 2 dependence of the re- sistivity up to room temperature for the out-of-plane re-0 1 2 3 4 5 6 FIG. 1: Crystal structure of <rs type="material">Ag5Pb2O6</rs>. sistivity of single crystals was recently reported by Shi- bata et al. at meetings of the Physical Society of Japan 11 . This dependence is rather unusual, because resistivity of almost all metals show T -linear dependence around room temperature due to the dominance of e-ph scattering. It was Jansen et al. who first succeeded in controlled synthesis of <rs type="material">polycrystalline Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> by high oxygen pressure method 8 . Recent report by H. Abe et al. on a new method to obtain single crystals 12 , made it pos- sible to perform more precise experiments. Neverthe- less, so far no article on experiments with single crystals has been published, although there are several articles on closely related materials, such as Bi and In substitution to the Pb site 13 , Cu substitution to the Pb site 14 and <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> with defects 15 . We note that there are also articles on powder samples by D. Djurek et al. report- ing several strange properties , which have not been reproduced by other groups to the best of our knowledge.</p>
        <p>We present here the first report on physical properties of <rs type="material">single crystalline Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> . We synthesized the single crystals and measured <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs>, <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> and <rs type="me_method">mag- netic susceptibility</rs>. In <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs>, we succeeded not only in reproducing the T 2 dependence of the out-of-plane <rs type="me_method">re- sistivity</rs>, but also in finding the same dependence of the in-plane <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> for the first time. We will discuss the possible origin of the unusual T 2 <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs>. What is more, we found a large signal of <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x7-98">diamagnetic</rs> phase transition around <rs corresp="#x7-98,#x24" type="tcValue">48 mK</rs>, which implies that bulk super- conducting phase exists in <rs type="material" xml:id="x24">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs>.</p>
        <p>The single crystals of <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> used in this study were grown by basically the same method as the one Shibata et al. reported . As starting materials, we used AgNO 3 (99.9999%) and Pb(NO 3 ) 2 (99.999%). We ground them in a mortar, and put the powder into thin Al 2 O 3 crusibles with a 10-mm inner diameter. The ratio of Ag and Pb is basically stoichiometric. The crusibles were heated in air to 80 • C and kept for 3 hours, then heated up to 300 • C in 8 hours and up to the reaction temperature at 394 • C in another 5 hours. We note here that one should cover the crusibles with larger crusibles or something in order to avoid pollution of the furnace, since melting AgNO 3 sometimes splashes out of the crusi- bles. The temperature was kept at this temperature for 48 hours, and the crusibles were furnace-cooled to room temperature .</p>
        <p>However, the crystals obtained with the above parame- ters do not have well-defined shapes as shown in (a) thus they are not suitable for resistivity measurements. We found that we can grow better-shaped crystals by choosing lower reaction temperatures. Furthermore, we also discovered that adding extra AgNO 3 promotes the growth, because AgNO 3 , which melts at 212 • C, appar- ently plays a role of self-flux. (b) shows the crystals grown with twice amount of AgNO 3 and with a reaction at 380 • C. Using this process, we obtained crys- tals in the shape of hexagonal sticks, which are shown in (c)(d). The long axis of the sticks are along the c axis. The largest size of crystals was approximately 1 mm in length and 0.5 mm in thickness.</p>
        <p>For characterization of the obtained crystals, we used powder X-ray diffractmetry with CuKα 1 radia- tion, which confirmed that these crystals were <rs type="material">single- phased Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> . <rs type="me_method">Resistivity</rs> was measured using a standard four-probe method with dc or ac current. <rs type="me_method">Spe- cific heat</rs> was measured with a commercial calorimeter (Quantum Design, model PPMS), and dc <rs type="me_method">susceptibil- ity</rs> by a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design, model MPMS). <rs type="me_method">AC susceptibility</rs> was measured by a mutual inductance method down to 38 mK using a 4 He-3 He di- lution refrigerator.</p>
        <p>We note here about the lowest temperature of the <rs type="me_method">re- sistivity</rs> measurement. We used an ultrasonic soldering</p>
        <p>Photos of <rs type="material">single crystals of Ag5Pb2O6</rs> taken with optical microscopes. The long axis of these crystals are along the c axis. (a) Single crystals in a crusible which are obtained with basic reaction parameters described in the text. (b) Sin- gle crystals at the bottom of a crusible when we mixed AgNO3 and Pb(NO3)2 with a ratio of Ag:Pb=5:1 and also chose a lower reaction temperature (380 • C). The crystals grew dis- persed from each other and the shapes became better with the aid of self-flux AgNO3. In this case AgNO3 little re- mained since most of unreacted AgNO3 had been evaporated or resolved into Ag metal. (c) A group of single crystals re- moved from the crusible in photo (b). We obtained a lot of crystals with a perfectly hexagonal-stick shape by adding self-flux AgNO3. (d) A cross section of a typical single crystal (not the largest). This hexagonal plane is in the ab plane of <rs type="material">Ag5Pb2O6</rs>. method to attach the leads to the crystals, because sev- eral conductive pastes (e.g. silver paste) we used all dam- aged the sample seriously. On the other hand, the sol- der we used (<rs type="material" xml:id="x31">Cerasolzer #123</rs>, Senju Metal Industry) be- comes <rs type="tc">superconducting</rs> <rs corresp="#x31" type="tcValue">below 3 K</rs>, which makes it impos- sible for us to measure the sample <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> accurately below 3 K. We should also note that the accuracy of in-plane <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> is less reliable than that of the out-of- plane <rs type="me_method">resistivity.</rs> This is because we could not shape up the samples before attaching leads to the crystal. Thus the electric current did not flow uniformly and we could not determine ρ by the simple relation as <rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> = R(S/l), where S is the cross section and l is the lead spacing. The results of ρ ab shown in is an estimation as- suming uniform current flow. Nevertheless, the relative variation of <rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> in temperature should be reliable.</p>
        <p>III. RESULTS shows the <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> along the c axis (<rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> c ) and in the ab plane (<rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> ab ). Anisotropy of <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> at 280 K is rather small and approximately 2, which is consistent with the results of the band calculation by Brennan et al. The residual <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> for <rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> c and <rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> ab are 9.7 µΩcm and 1.5 µΩcm, respectively; this means residual <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> ratio (RRR) are 35 for <rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> c and 93 for <rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> ab , which show that the quality of the samples was quite good. If we assume its temperature dependence as</p>

Solid lines are the fitting with ρ(T ) = ρ0 + A ′ T p with p = 2.13 for ρc and p = 2.11 for <rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> ab . Dashed lines are the fitting assuming the existence of a Einstein-like optic phonon mode. ρ(T ) = ρ 0 + A ′ T p , we obtained the exponent as p = 2.13 for ρ c and p = 2.11 for ρ ab from the fitting in all temper- ature range . For both direction, p is close to 2; thus if we approximate as ρ(T ) = ρ 0 + AT 2 , we obtained the coefficient of T 2 term A c = 3.78 × 10 −3 µΩcm/K 2 for <rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> c (T ) and A ab = 1.6 × 10 −3 µΩcm/K 2 for <rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> ab (T ). The measured specific heat is shown in . Since <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> does not contain any magnetic ions, we ex- press C P in 1-mol formula unit, in other words, of 1-mol conduction electrons. In high temperature region, C P converges to a constant value, which agrees with Dulong-Petit's classical phonon specific heat, C cl = 3k B rN A = 324 J/K mol 19 , where r = 13 is the number of atoms in one formula unit. We also measured the <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> in magnetic fields, but there was no difference between the data in 0 T and in 7 T. The inset is the C P /T -vs.-T 2 plot below 3.3 K. We obtained the electronic specific heat co- efficient γ e = 3.42 mJ/K 2 mol and the Debye temperature Θ D = 186 K from this plot.</p>
        <p><rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> displays weak constant diamagnetism in 10 K &lt; T &lt; 350 K, (−2.07 ± 0.02) × 10 −4 emu/mol, from dc <rs type="me_method">susceptibility</rs> measurement. Below 10 K, χ dc in- creases probably owing to paramagnetic impurities. To subtract the diamagnetic contribution from the ion cores, we used the values of the <rs type="me_method">susceptibility</rs> of cores in the literature 20 ; we estimated the total contribution from the cores as −2.44 × 10 −4 emu/mol. When we sub- tracted this value from the experimental value, we ob- tained (+3.7 ± 0.2) × 10 −5 emu/mol. This is the Pauli susceptibility of conduction electrons because there are no magnetic ions in <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs>.</p>
        <p>In the ac <rs type="me_method">susceptibility</rs> measurement, we found a very large signal around <rs corresp="#x44" type="tcValue">45 mK</rs> as shown in</p>
        <p>The signal was reproducible in different samples, in different suscep-Specific heat of <rs type="material">Ag5Pb2O6</rs> down to 0.35 K. These figures contain the results of several different samples. Inset: CP /T plotted against T 2 below 3.3 K.

We also measured <rs type="me_method">ac susceptibility</rs> of a bulk pure Al with approximately the same volume as the measured <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> using the same cell, and found that <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> yields as large a diamagnetic signal as that of the superconducting transition of Al. Moreover, this transition disappears under a few Oe magnetic field, and <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> does not contain any magnetic ions which may cause a diamagnetic transition. Thus this signal strongly implies the existence of a bulk superconducting phase of <rs type="material" xml:id="x44">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> . The inset of is the phase diagram of this new phase. "H c (T )" was determined from the peaks of imaginary part χ ′′ ac by sweeping magnetic field at each fixed temperature. We note that values of H in the inset of is shifted because exact zero point of our magnet changed by a few Oe due to the residual magnetic field. Thus we swept magnetic field from +10 Oe to −10 Oe and determined exact zero point from the symmetry of the χ ac data. "H c " is well fitted by a parabolic law for superconductor: where H c0 = 3.0 Oe and <rs type="tc">T c0</rs> = <rs type="tcValue">48 mK</rs> obtained by fitting. This variation also supports the evidence of superconductivity.</p>
        <p>Now we discuss the origin of the T 2 dependence of re- sistivity. One possibility is e-e interaction. Resistivity of materials in which strong e-e correlation exists shows T 2 dependence only at temperature much lower than room temperature, because the characteristic temperature of many-body Fermi liquid formation is low and also the T 2 -behavior requires the dominance of the e-e scattering over the e-ph scattering. If the ρ ∝ T 2 law up to room temperature of <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> comes from the e-e correlation, the e-e correlation must be so large as to dominate over</p>
        <p>AC <rs type="me_method">magnetic susceptibility</rs> below 0.1 K, measured with an ac magnetic field of amplitude 2.3 × 10 −2 Oe and frequency 887 Hz. A very large <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x49">diamagnetic phase transition signal</rs> was found <rs corresp="#x49,#x52" type="tcValue">below 45 mK</rs>, which suggests the <rs type="tc">existence of a superconducting</rs> (SC) phase. Inset: Phase diagram of <rs type="material" xml:id="x52">Ag5Pb2O6</rs> below 50 mK. Closed squares are "Hc" determined from the peaks of imaginary part χ ′′ ac . Dashed line shows the classical parabolic law of superconductivity: Hc(T ) = Hc0[1 − (T /Tc0) 2 ]. the e-ph scattering even at room temperature. But it seems impossible to expect strong e-e interaction from the discussions below. First, the electronic <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> coefficient of <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> is comparable to those of nor- mal metals and 1 ∼ 3 orders of magnitude smaller than those of strongly-correlated electron systems. Moreover, neither the Wilson ratio nor the Kadowaki-Woods (K-W) ratio shows evidence of strong e-e correlations. The Wilson ratio, which is given by (π 2 k 2 B /3µ 2 B )(χ Pauli /γ e ), is expected to increase from unity to 2 as e-e interac- tion increases from 0 to ∞ 21 . In <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> , the Wilson ratio is 0.79, close to unity, implying that the e-e interac- tion is weak. Of course we should note that the value of χ Pauli may not be very accurate because the subtracted core contribution is much larger than χ Pauli . The K-W ratio is defined as A/γ 2 e and becomes a universal value a 0 = 1.0 × 10 −5 µΩcm(K mol/mJ) 2 in most strongly- correlated systems . The K-W ratio of <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> is 32.3a 0 for <rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> c and approximately 14a 0 for <rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> ab ; both are much larger than a 0 . These deviation imply that <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> cannot be classified into strongly-correlated electron systems and that the T 2 dependence of <rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> is not due to e-e interaction.</p>
        <p>Another possible origin is the e-ph scattering. Ba- sically, resistivity governed by the e-ph interaction is T -linear above Θ D /5 (≈ 20 ∼ 100 K, in most met- als). But there are some materials of which resistivity shows non-linear T dependence at <rs type="me_method">relatively</rs> high tem- perature because of the e-ph scattering by high energy optic phonons. For example, <rs type="material">MgB 2</rs> shows ρ ∝ T 2 behav- ior in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> &lt; T 240 K 4,5 , and ReO 3 exhibits an unusual curvature in the <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> in 120 K T 220 K 23 . When analyzing non-linear T dependence of <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> in these materials, it is a common approach to assume the optic phonons as Einstein-like . In this method, the Boltzmann equation is a starting point: where x = ω/2k B T , α 2 F (ω) is the Eliashberg function, ω p is the plasma frequency of conduction electrons. We assume that we can separate the Eliashberg function into the Debye term and the Einstein term: where Ω D and Ω E are the Debye frequency and the fre- quency of Einstein phonons, respectively, and λ D and λ E are the e-ph coupling constant of Debye phonons and of Einstein phonons, respectively. Now we can sub- stitute this Eliashberg function into Eq. 1, and fit it with the experimental data. When we used k B Ω D / , k B Ω E / , λ D /ω 2 p and λ E /ω 2 p as fitting parameters, we ob- tained k B Ω D / = 290 K and k B Ω E / = 1200 K from the fitting with <rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> c data, and k B Ω D / = 280 K and k B Ω E / = 1100 K from <rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> ab . The results of the fittings are shown in with dashed lines. But the existence of such a high frequency Einstein-like phonon is doubtful. This is because specific heat shown in converges to Dulong-Petit's value around 350 K, implying that all phonon modes are "freely" excited at this temperature and thus there seems to be no more phonon mode with energy much larger than 350 K 25 . For comparison, the <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> of <rs type="material">MgB 2</rs> , in which the optic phonon mode with a wavenumber of 620 cm −1 (890 K in energy) plays important roles, is indeed not at all saturated even at 300 K 26 .</p>
        <p>If we assume that the novel phase below 48 mK is a phonon-mediated superconducting phase, we can es- timate the e-ph coupling constant λ from McMillan's relation : When we assumed the psudopotential as µ * = 0.1 and used Θ D = 186 K, we obtained λ = 0.288, which is com- parable to those of <rs type="material" xml:id="x21-69">W</rs> (λ = 0.28, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x21-69" type="tcValue">12 mK</rs>) or <rs type="material" xml:id="x21-84">Be</rs> (λ = 0.23, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x21-84" type="tcValue">26 mK</rs>) . Such a small λ may be an- other evidence that strong e-ph interaction does not exist in <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> . The unusual ρ ∝ T 2 behavior up to room tempera- ture thus can be attributed to neither e-e interaction nor e-ph interaction including the optic phonons. We note here that a one-dimensional chain organic compound TTF-TCNQ exhibits T 2.33 dependence of resistivity in 60 K &lt; T &lt; 300 K 28 , attributable to the librational phonon mode in the chain . This scenario is not appli- cable to <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> because of the rigidness of the lattice against twisting motion of the silver chain. Neverthe- less, a unique phonon mode may exist also in <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> which gives rise to the T 2 dependence. Thus a detailed investigation into the phonon modes in <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> and into their strength of coupling with conduction electrons may elucidate the T 2 dependence.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we synthesized <rs type="material">single crystals of Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> and measured their <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs>, <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> and <rs type="me_method">magnetic susceptibility</rs>. The <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> exhibits un- usual T 2 dependence up to room temperature both along the c axis and in the ab plane. This behavior cannot be explained by e-e interaction. It seems also impossible to explain the T 2 dependence from the e-ph scattering by optic phonons. Thus there should be other scattering mechanisms in <rs type="material" xml:id="x73">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs> . Moreover, a phase transition with a large <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x74">diamagnetic signal</rs> was found <rs corresp="#x73,#x74" type="tcValue">below 48 mK</rs> and below 3 Oe. This new phase seems to be a bulk superconducting phase in <rs type="material">Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6</rs>.</p>
