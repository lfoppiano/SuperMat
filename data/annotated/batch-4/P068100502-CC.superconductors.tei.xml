          <p>We report detailed thermodynamic and transport measurements for non-superconducting <rs type="material">La1.7Sr0.3CuO4</rs>. Collectively, these data reveal that a highly-correlated Fermi-liquid ground state exists in <rs type="material">La2−xSrxCuO4</rs> beyond the superconducting dome, and confirm that charge transport in the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> is dominated at finite temperatures by intense electron-electron scattering.</p>

    <p>The high-T c <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> (HTC) have emerged as one of the most formidable challenges facing the theory of cor- related electrons in solids . In particular, transport properties of the normal state present a number of un- easy paradoxes for the Fermi-liquid (FL) picture. Whilst it has been argued that conventional electron-phonon (e- ph) scattering might still account for the T -linear <rs type="me_method">resis- tivity</rs> in <rs type="class">optimally doped cuprates</rs>, it is generally as- sumed that proximity to a Mott insulator, and thus the unusual strength of on-site electronic repulsion, is the fundamental reason behind the more unusual aspects of HTC physics. This general assumption is backed up by a host of experimental observations which indicate that the anomalous behavior becomes even more pronounced with decreasing the density of carriers, that is, by moving towards the underdoped side. At sufficiently high carrier concentrations however, it has often been assumed that HTC eventually evolve into a conventional FL as the elec- tron correlations become weaker and the system becomes more three-dimensional (3D).</p>
    <p>Ironically, the persistence of robust <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> on the overdoped (OD) side of the phase diagram has been a major obstacle in the exploration of the metal- lic non-superconducting ground state in HTC. Indeed, supporting evidence for a FL ground state has only sur- faced very recently with the experimental verification of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law in <rs type="material" xml:id="x5">OD Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+δ (Tl2201)</rs> (<rs type="tc">T c</rs> ∼ <rs corresp="#x5" type="tcValue">15K</rs>) . By <rs type="tc">suppressing superconduc- tivity</rs> in a large magnetic field, Proust et al. observed the precise WF ratio κ ab /σ ab T = L 0 , where κ ab and σ ab are the in-plane thermal and electrical conductivities and the Lorenz number L 0 = 2.44 × 10 −8 WΩ/K −2 . Sur- prisingly however, and at odds with a conventional FL picture, the WF relation was found to co-exist with a large linear resistivity term extending down to 0K. This dichotomy raises the question whether the field-induced 'normal state' in <rs type="class">OD HTC</rs>, i.e. beyond H c2 , is the same as the ground state that would exist in the absence of a magnetic field, as it does in more conventional super- conductors. Moreover, a clear understanding of the ex- perimental situation in <rs type="class">OD cuprates</rs> has often been com-pounded by their tendency to undergo phase separation.</p>
    <p>In this Letter, we present in-(<rs type="me_method">ρ ab</rs> ) and out-of- plane (<rs type="me_method">ρ c</rs> ) <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs>, in-(κ ab ) and out-of-plane (κ c ) thermal conductivity, <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> (C) and <rs type="me_method">magnetic susceptibility</rs> (<rs type="me_method">χ</rs>) measurements on single-phase non- superconducting <rs type="material">La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) crystals (x = 0.30)</rs> in which these various concerns are removed. Collectively, the data provide a consistent picture of <rs type="material">La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4</rs> as a highly-correlated FL. The WF law is verified to within our experimental resolution, though in contrast to <rs type="material">OD Tl2201</rs>, both <rs type="me_method">ρ ab</rs> and <rs type="me_method">ρ c</rs> exhibit strictly T 2 behavior below 50K, with no additional linear term. Significantly, the Kadowaki-Woods ratio, linking the co- efficient A of the (in-plane) T 2 <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> and the square of the linear <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> coefficient γ 0 , is found to be anomalously enhanced, even compared with other strongly correlated metals. This latter observation re- veals that intense e-e interactions persist beyond the <rs type="tc">su- perconducting</rs> dome and sheds important new light on the evolution of <rs type="me_method">ρ ab</rs> (T ) across the HTC phase diagram.</p>
    <ab type="figureCaption">Seven bar-shaped samples (typical dimensions 3 mm x 0.6 mm x 0.6 mm) were prepared for either ab- plane (A1-4) or c-axis (C1-3) measurements from a large <rs type="material">La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4 single crystal</rs> grown in an infra-red im- age furnace. The individual ingots were post-annealed together with the remaining boule under extremely high partial pressures of oxygen (400 atm) for 2 weeks at 900 • C to minimize oxygen deficiencies and to ensure good homogeneity within each crystal. Subsequent X-ray anal- ysis revealed good crystallinity and no trace of <rs type="tc">supercon- ductivity</rs> could be detected (resistively) down to 95mK (see top inset to ), confirming that these crystals were indeed single-phase. χ(T ) of the boule was mea- sured with a commercial magnetometer, whilst C(T ) was measured between 0.6K and 10K in a relaxation calorime- ter. In both cases, addenda contributions were measured independently and subtracted from the raw data. κ(T ) of A1, A2 and C1 were measured in a dilution refrig- erator using three RuO 2 chips employed as one heater and two thermometers. <rs type="me_method">ρ(T ) measurements</rs> were made on all seven samples using a conventional ac four-probe</ab>

For all transport measurements, current and voltage contacts were painted onto the crystals so as to short out any spurious voltage drops from orthogonal components of the conductivity tensor. Uncertainty in the geometrical factor was estimated to be ∼ 20%. Fi- nally, c-axis magnetoresistance ∆ρ c /ρ c data were taken on C1 at the NHMFL in Florida. shows ρ(T ) of A1, A2 and C1 below 300K. (All crystals reported here showed similar behavior). Note the similar metallic T -dependencies observed along both or- thogonal directions, the different residual resistivity (ρ 0 ) values for A1 and A2, and the strong upward curvature across the entire temperature range. The <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> ra- tio ρ c (C1)/ρ ab (A1) rises from ∼ 65 at 300K to ∼ 80 as T → 0, presumably due to slight differences in their ρ 0 values. The limiting low-T <rs type="me_method">resistivities</rs> of C1 and A3 are reproduced in the top inset to . No current de- pendence was observed in ρ(T ) down to 0.1A/cm 2 , well below the typical critical current densities found in HTC. The lower inset shows ∆ρ c /ρ c for C1 (B ab) plotted ver- sus B 2 at T = 0.5K. Inserting the fit to the low-field data (see caption) into the Boltzmann transport equa- tion for a quasi-2D FL (see, e.g. ), we obtain an esti- mate of the in-plane electronic mean-free-path ℓ ab ∼ 145 A. Finally, using k F = 0.55Å −1 for <rs type="material">La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4</rs> and the "isotropic-ℓ" approximation , we obtain ρ ab0 = 21µΩcm, in good agreement with ρ 0 (A1).</p>

Inset: <rs type="me_method">ρ</rs> vs. T 2 for A4. integer power-law <rs type="me_method">resistivities</rs> were shown to extend from the lowest temperatures up to 1000K. Whilst <rs type="me_method">ρ(T )</rs> of our crystals follows very closely a T 1.6 dependence at ele- vated temperatures, the T -dependence clearly becomes stronger than T 1.6 as T drops below around 100K. In- deed, as shown in the bottom panel in , (ρ - 0 )(T ) = AT 2 up to at least T = 55K for both cur- rent directions (ρ -ρ 0 )(T ) for A4 is shown in an in- set for clarity). Significantly, A has the same magni- tude (∼ 2.5 ± 0.1 nΩcm/K 2 ) for all in-plane crystals, even though ρ 0 (A2,A3) ∼ 2 ρ 0 (A1,A4). To our knowl- edge, this is the first time a pure T 2 <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> has been resolved in a <rs type="class">hole-doped cuprate</rs> (recall that in <rs type="material">OD Tl2201</rs>, (ρ − ρ 0 )(T ) = αT + AT 2 ) and implies that in <rs type="material">La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4</rs>, charge transport can be understood in terms of an anisotropic 3D FL .</p>
      <p>In , the low-T thermal conductivities of A1, A2 and C1 are plotted as κ/T versus T 2 . Note that A1 and A2 are better conductors of heat, as expected since σ c ≪ σ ab , and that κ(A1) &gt; κ(A2), reflecting their respective ρ 0 values. The sizeable phonon term (κ ph ) in HTC has often been a major obstacle to the determination of κ el , the electronic contribution to κ(T ) and the chief quan- tity of interest. Typically, κ ph can only be unambigu- ously determined in the ballistic limit, below say 0.2K, where κ ph is simply proportional to β 3 T 3 , the low-T lat-</p>

The dotted lines give κ el /T as T → 0. tice heat capacity, as found here for C1 and indicated in the figure by a solid line. If κ ph were isotropic, a more insightful approach might be to measure both κ ab and κ c on identical crystals and make use of the large σ ab /σ c anisotropy in HTC to delineate κ el from κ ab across the entire temperature range. A quick inspection of however reveals that κ ab /T and κ c /T are not simply offset from one an- other, implying either a T -dependent κ el /T at low-T or anisotropy in κ ph (T ) for in-and out-of-plane heat flow, due, for example, to anisotropy in the phonon veloci- ties or e-ph coupling. The fact though that κ/T (A1) and κ/T (A2) are shifted relative to one another (except at the very lowest temperatures) suggests the latter, and sim- ply by scaling κ c (T ) by a constant factor (f = 1.6) and subtracting it from κ ab (T ), we find, as shown in the inset to , that the resultant κ el /T is indeed constant for both crystals and equal to 1.07 and 0.50 mW/cm.K 2 for A1 and A2 respectively (the dotted lines). This gives ρ 0 = L 0 T /κ el = 23 (A1) and 49 (A2) µΩcm, compared with the measured values of 19 and 42 µΩcm. Given our some- what simplistic way of extracting κ ph (T ) from κ ab (T ), it is encouraging to find that the WF law is satisfied for both crystals to within our experimental (geometrical) error. It should be stressed here that σ ab0 (<rs type="material">LSCO</rs>) is al- most an order of magnitude smaller than in <rs type="material">OD Tl2201</rs> , thus making determination of κ el /T more difficult.</p>
      <p>The surprising feature of is of course the strong downturn in κ(A1) as T → 0. (A slight downturn is also observed for A2 below 0.1K, though nowhere near as dra-matic.) While slight deviations from the WF law can be attributed to additional anisotropy in κ ph not yet ac- counted for, there is no assumption on κ ph (T ) which can erase the sudden vanishing of κ el below 0.2K for A1. Note that this downturn is robust both to changes in the ther- mal contacts and the crystal dimensions. Intriguingly, a vanishing of κ el has also been observed in the <rs type="class">electron- doped cuprate</rs>
      <rs type="material">Pr 2−x Ce x CuO 4 (PCCO)</rs> . By suppress- ing <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> with a high magnetic field, Hill et al. found that κ el /T , whilst violating the WF law for T &gt; 0.3K (in the sense that it clearly exceeds L 0 /ρ(T ), rapidly vanishes as T falls below 0.3K. These two anoma- lous observations appear to have a common origin. The sample-dependent aspect of the downturn, however, sug- gests that it may be extrinsic in origin and unrelated to any exotic electronic behavior, particularly in view of the other, more conventional results obtained here for <rs type="material">La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4</rs> above 0.2K. We reserve a detailed dis- cussion on the origin of this anomalous downturn to a more complete and systematic investigation .</p>
      <p>The <rs type="tc">absence of superconductivity</rs> in <rs type="material">La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4</rs> , coupled with the emergence of a T 2 <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> at low T , gives us a unique opportunity to compare experimen- tal manifestations of e-e correlations in <rs type="material">La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4</rs> to other strongly correlated systems. Electronic cor- relations in a FL are known to lead to an enhance- ment in the quasi-particle effective mass. This effect can be detected through the <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> (AT 2 ), <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> (γ 0 T ) and <rs type="me_method">magnetic susceptibility</rs> (χ p ). Empirical rela- tionships that correlate these physical parameters have been found in a wide range of strongly-correlated metals; namely, the Kadowaki-Woods (KW) ratio (A/γ 2 0 = a 0 = 10 −5 µΩcm/(mJ/Kmol) 2 ) and the Wilson ratio ) χ p /γ 0 , with R w ∼ 1 for a free electron gas and ∼ 2 for strongly-correlated fermions ).</p>
      <p>The lower inset to shows <rs type="me_method">C(T )</rs> of the large crys- tal boule plotted as C/T versus T 2 . <rs type="me_method">C(T )</rs> can be fitted over the whole temperature range (0.6K &lt; T &lt; 10K) to the expression C = αT −2 + γ 0 T + β 3 T 3 + β 5 T 5 with α = 76 µJ.K/mol., γ 0 = 6.9 mJ/mol.K 2 , β 3 = 0.1 mJ/mol.K 4 and β 5 = 0.7 µJ/mol.K 6 . The αT −2 term represents the high temperature tail of a Schottky anomaly that invari- ably develops in HTC samples at low T due to either a small concentration of isolated paramagnetic impuri- ties, or to nuclear hyperfine or quadrupole splitting. The phononic β 3 T 3 term is comparatively small and gives rise to an elevated Θ D = 550K, though β 3 may be made ar- tificially low by a T -dependent electronic term .</p>
      <p>The magnitude of γ 0 , though, is very robust in our measurements, is comparable to previous reports at this doping level and gives a corresponding KW ratio, A/γ 2 0 ∼ 5a 0 . This puts non-superconducting <rs type="material">LSCO</rs> well off the so-called 'universal' line for strongly correlated metals indicated in . A similarly enhanced KW ra- tio, i.e. A/γ 2 0 ≥ 5a 0 , can also be inferred for <rs type="material">OD Tl2201</rs></p>

Upper inset: <rs type="me_method">Magnetic susceptibility</rs> χ(T ) of large boule at 5T with B c (solid squares) and B ab (open circles).

(A = 5.4 nΩcmK −2 , γ 0 ∼ 10 mJ/mol.K 2 ), and indirectly for <rs type="material">OD PCCO</rs>, (A ∼ 4 nΩcmK −2 , γ 0 ∼ 6.7 mJ/mol.K 2 ). This observation reveals a new aspect of the physics of the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> and is the central result of this Letter. Whilst various explanations for the magni- tude of the KW ratio in <rs type="class">heavy fermion</rs> systems have been proposed, including a strong frequency dependence of the quasi-particle self-energy and proximity to an anti- ferromagnetic instability , none have so far predicted deviations from a 0 as large as those found in the HTC. It is noted, however, that the effect of a strong momen- tum dependence in the scattering amplitude, thought to be a key feature of HTC , has yet to be taken into account and efforts to include such an effect could prove highly illuminating. As one moves across the HTC phase diagram towards the Mott insulator at half-filling, one expects e-e scat- tering to become even more intense. Thus, the grad- ual evolution from quadratic to linear <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> in HTC must somehow reflect the growing strength of e-e inter- actions as one approaches the Mott insulator from the metallic side. As an indication of how rapidly the e-e scattering intensity might grow, we note here that ρ ab of <rs type="material">La 1.85 Sr 0.15 CuO 4</rs> is ≈ 2 -3 times larger than that of <rs type="material">La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4</rs> at 300K, even though the Luttinger sum rule dictates that their carrier densities differ by only a few percent. Moreover, given the relatively minor changes observed in the phonon spectra as a function of doping, one does not expect the strength of the e-ph in- teraction to change forcibly across the phase diagram. Thus, since e-ph scattering appears to give a negligi- ble contribution to ρ ab (T ) in <rs type="material">La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4</rs> , it seems highly unlikely now that e-ph scattering can in any way account for the linear resistivity that appears (in a nar- row composition range) around optimal doping. In the light of these results, we conclude that chronic (Umk- lapp) e-e scattering processes must dominate the normal state transport behavior of the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> across the entire accessible doping range. Such a scenario is consistent with the large increase in the quasi-particle lifetime be- low <rs type="tc">T c</rs> observed in thermal and <rs type="me_method">electrical conductivity</rs> measurements.</p>
    <p>Finally, let us comment briefly on the Wilson ratio R W . As shown in the upper inset to , χ(T ) displays significant anisotropy with respect to the field orientation (believed to arise from anisotropic g-values ) and a strong enhancement at low T . Assuming a constant Pauli susceptibility χ p and an isotropic Curie-Weiss term (with Θ C ∼ 7.5K), we obtain an average χ p ∼ 1.75× 10 −4 emu/mol and hence, R W ∼ 2.0, consistent with values for other strongly correlated metals . If however, all the enhancement in χ(T ) is assumed to be intrinsic, i.e. due to an enhanced χ p (T ), we obtain R W ∼ 3.5. We note here that whilst a large enhancement in χ p (T ) at low-T would imply a similar enhancement in γ(T ), such behavior would be difficult to discern from our C(T ) data due to the dominant phonon contribution.</p>
    <p>In summary, detailed low-T transport and thermody- namic measurements in <rs type="material">La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4</rs> have revealed for the first time that <rs type="material">LSCO</rs> develops a highly correlated FL ground state beyond the <rs type="tc">superconducting</rs> dome. The observed enhancement in the KW ratio suggests that e scattering in non-superconducting <rs type="material">LSCO</rs> is much more intense than previously imagined and raises serious ques- tion marks over previous claims that the ubiquitous lin- ear resistivity observed in <rs type="class">optimally-doped cuprates</rs> is a signature of (strong) e-ph coupling.</p>
