          <p>A spontaneous vortex state (SVS) between 30 K and 56 K was observed for the weak-ferromagnetic superconductor <rs type="material" xml:id="x2">RuSr2GdCu2O8</rs> with ferromagnetic Curie temperature TC = 131 K and <rs type="tc">supercon- ducting transition temperature</rs> <rs type="tc">Tc</rs> = <rs corresp="#x2" type="tcValue">56 K</rs>. The low field (±20 G) superconducting hysteresis loop indicates a narrow Meissner state region within average lower critical field Bc1(T)= Bc1(0)[1 -(T/T0) 2 ], with average B ave c1 (0) = 12 G and T0 = 30 K. Full Meissner shielding signal in very low applied field indicates an ab-plane B ab c1 (0) ∼ 4 G with an estimated anisotropic parameter γ ∼ 7 for this layered system. The existence of a spontaneous vortex state between 30 K and 56 K is the result of weak-ferromagnetic order with a net spontaneous magnetic moment of ∼ 0.1 µB/Ru, which generates a weak magnetic dipole field around 10 G in the CuO2 bi-layers. The upper critical field Bc2 varies linearly as (1 -T/Tc) up to 7-T field. The vortex melting line Bm varies as (1 -T/Tm) 3.5 with melting transition temperature Tm = 39 K and a very broad vortex liquid region due to the coexistence and the interplay between superconductivity and weak-ferromagnetic order.</p>

    <p>Recently, high-T c superconductivity with anoma- lous magnetic properties was reported in the weak- ferromagnetic <rs type="class">Ru-1212</rs> system <rs type="material">RuSr 2 RCu 2 O 8 (R = Sm, Eu, Gd, Y)</rs> with the tetragonal TlBa 2 CaCu 2 O 7 -type structure. For the Ca-substituted system, a possible supercon- ductivity was also reported in the weak-ferromagnetic compounds <rs type="material">RuCa 2 RCu 2 O 8 (R = Pr-Gd)</rs>. The metallic weak-ferromagnetic (WFM) order is originated from the long range order of Ru moments in the RuO 6 octahedra due to strong Ru-4d xy,yz,zx -O-2p x,y,z hybridization in this strongly-correlated electron sys- tem. The Curie temperature T C ∼ 130 K observed from magnetization measurement in the prototype compound <rs type="material">RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8</rs> is probably a canted G-type antiferromagnetic order with Ru 5+ moment µ canted along the tetragonal basal plane resulting a small net spontaneous magnetic moment µ s ≪ µ(Ru 5+ ) too small to be detected in neutron diffraction. The occurrence of high-T c superconductivity with maximum <rs type="tc">resistivity onset T c (onset)</rs> ∼ <rs corresp="#x11" type="tcValue">60 K</rs> in <rs type="material" xml:id="x11">RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8</rs> is related with the quasi-two-dimensional CuO 2 bi- layers separated by a rare earth layer in the <rs type="class">Ru-1212</rs> structure. Broad <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> transition width ∆T c = T c (onset) -T c (zero) ∼ 15-20 K observed is most likely originated from the coexistence and the inter- play between superconductivity and weak-ferromagnetic order. The diamagnetic <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is observed anomalously at lower temperature near <rs type="tc">T c (zero)</rs> instead of at <rs type="tc">T c (onset)</rs>, and a reasonable large Meissner signal was reported using stationary sample magnetometer with diamagnetic <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ∼ <rs type="tcValue">30 K</rs> in ≤ 1 G applied field at <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x18">zero-field-cooled (ZFC)</rs> mode. <rs type="tc">Lower T c (onset)</rs> ∼ <rs corresp="#x18,#x22" type="tcValue">40 K</rs> and <rs corresp="#x23" type="tcValue">12 K</rs> were observed for <rs type="material" xml:id="x22">RuSr 2 EuCu 2 O 8</rs> and <rs type="material" xml:id="x23">RuSr 2 SmCu 2 O 8</rs> , respectively. <rs type="tc">No superconductivity</rs> can be detected in <rs type="material">RuSr 2 RCu 2 O 8 (R = Pr, Nd)</rs>. 3,16 Superconducting <rs type="material">RuSr 2 YCu 2 O 8</rs> phase is stable only under the high pressure. The physics is still unclear in this system, and it will be interesting to investigate the effect of the weak- ferromagnetic order on superconducting critical fields B c2 and B c1 , as well as on the possible existence of a spon- taneous vortex state (SVS) at higher temperature above the Meissner state.</p>
    <p>The stoichiometric <rs type="material">RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8</rs> samples were syn- thesized by the standard solid-state reaction method. High-purity RuO 2 (99.99 %), SrCO 3 (99.99 %), Gd 2 O 3 (99.99 %), and CuO (99.99 %) preheated powders with the nominal composition ratio of Ru:Sr:Gd:Cu = 1: 2: 1: 2 were well mixed and calcined at 960 • C in air for 16 hours. The calcined powders were then pressed into pel- lets and sintered in flowing N 2 gas at 1015 • C for 10 hours to form RuSr 2 GdO 6 and Cu 2 O precursors. This step is crucial in order to avoid the formation of unwanted im- purity phases. The N 2 -sintered pellets were heated at 1060 • C in flowing O 2 gas for 10 hours to form the <rs type="class">Ru-1212</rs> phase. The pellets were oxygen-annealed at slightly higher 1065 • C for 5 days and slowly furnace-cooled to room temperature with a rate of 15 • C per hour. The powder x-ray diffraction data were collected with a Rigaku Rotaflex 18-kW rotating anode diffractometer</p>
    <p>Electrical <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> <rs type="me_method">ρ(T)</rs> and volume <rs type="me_method">magnetic susceptibility</rs> χV (T) at 1-G field-cooled (FC) and zero-field- cooled (ZFC) modes for oxygen-annealed <rs type="material">RuSr2GdCu2O8</rs> using graphite monochromatized Cu-K α radiation with a scanning step of 0.02 • (10 second counting time per step) in the 2 θ ranges of 5-100 • . The <rs type="me_method">electrical resistivity</rs> and magneto-resistivity measurements were performed using the standard four-probe method with a Linear Research LR-700 ac (16Hz) resistance bridge from 2 K to 300 K with applied magnetic field up to 7 T. The magnetization, <rs type="me_method">magnetic susceptibility</rs> and magnetic hysteresis measure- ments from 2 K to 300 K with applied fields from 1 G to 7 T were carried out with a Quantum Design 1-T µ- metal shielded MPMS2 or a 7-T MPMS superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer.</p>
    <p>The powder x-ray diffraction pattern for the oxygen- annealed <rs type="material">RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8</rs> polycrystalline sample indi- cates close to single phase with the tetragonal lattice pa- rameters of a = 0.5428(5) nm and c = 1.1589(9) nm. The space group P4/mbm is used for Rietveld refine- ment analysis, where neutron diffraction data indicate that a RuO 6 octahedra 14 • rotation around the c-axis is needed to accommodate physically reasonable Ru-O bond lengths. The refinement gives a good residual er- ror R of 3.64 %, weighted pattern error R wp = 6.07 %, and Bragg error R B = 5.05 %.</p>
    <p>The temperature dependence of the electrical <rs type="me_method">resistiv- ity</rs> <rs type="me_method">ρ(T)</rs> and the volume <rs type="me_method">magnetic susceptibility</rs> χ V (T) at 1-G field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) modes for <rs type="material">RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8</rs> are shown collectively in . The high temperature <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> decreases monotonically from room temperature value of 9.2 mΩ.cm (not shown) to 6.4 mΩ.cm at 200 K, and extrapolated to 2.8 mΩ.cm at 0 K with a good <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> ratio ρ(300 K)/ρ(0 K) of 3.3 for the polycrystalline sample. High temperature <rs type="me_method">resis- tivity</rs> shows a non-Fermi-liquid-like linear T-dependence down to Curie temperature T C of 131 K, then changes</p>

Note that the full Meissner shielding signal was observed only at low applied field and low temperature. to a T 2 behavior below T C due to magnetic order.</p>
    <p>The <rs type="tc">superconducting onset temperature</rs> of <rs corresp="#x38" type="tcValue">56 K</rs> is determined from the deviation from T 2 behavior, with a <rs type="tc">zero resistivity T c (zero)</rs> at <rs corresp="#x38" type="tcValue">39 K</rs>. The broad transi- tion width ∆T c = 17 K observed is the common feature for all reported <rs type="material">Ru-1212</rs> <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> data, which indicates that the superconducting Josephson coupling along the tetragonal c-axis between Cu-O bi-layers may be par- tially blocked by the dipole field B dipole of ordered Ru moments in the Ru-O layer. The diamagnetic <rs type="tc">T c</rs> at <rs corresp="#x46" type="tcValue">39 K</rs> was observed in the 1-G ZFC <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x46">susceptibility measurement</rs>. The full Meissner shielding signal 4πχ V = 4πM/B a ∼ -1.5 (Gaussian units) was recorded at 5 K. This value is identical to the Meissner shielding sig- nal expected for a superconducting sphere with a demag- netization factor N of -4π/3 and in an applied field B a well below lower critical field B c1 . The large diamag- netic signal in 1-G ZFC mode is the best data observed so far from various reported <rs type="me_method">susceptibility</rs> measurement techniques. Since our measurements were per- formed with the standard moving-sample SQUID mag- netometer, it is clear that sample quality is more crucial than measuring techniques. Both ZFC and FC data re- veal a Curie temperature T C of 131 K. However, in 1-G FC mode, no diamagnetic field-expulsion signal can be detected below 39 K due to strong flux pinning where superconductivity coexists with weak-ferromagnetic or- der.</p>
    <p>The zero-field-cooled (ZFC) volume <rs type="me_method">susceptibility</rs> χ V (T) at 1 G, 10 G, and 100 G applied fields are shown collectively in . All data show the same magnetic order T C (Ru) of 131 K. Although the <rs type="tc">diamagnetic T c</rs> of <rs corresp="#x49" type="tcValue">39 K</rs> was still observed at 10-G ZFC measurement, the diamagnetic signal at 5 K is reduced to 60% of the full Meissner signal. Consider the polycrystalline nature of sample with varying microcrystallite size and orientation, the average superconducting lower critical field B c1 at 5</p>
    <p>Low field superconducting hysteresis loops M-Ba for <rs type="material" xml:id="x49">RuSr2GdCu2O8</rs>: (a) at 5 K, 10 K, 15 K, 20 K; (b) at 25 K, 30 K, and 35 K. K is estimated to be close to 10 G. No net diamagnetic signal can be detected at 100-G ZFC mode where the sample is already in the vortex glass or lattice state and the small diamagnetic signal is overshadowed by a large weak-ferromagnetic background. Based on this information, the low-field (±20 G) isothermal superconducting hysteresis loops M-B a are measured and collectively shown in (a) (5 K, 10 K, 15 K, and 20 K) and 3(b) (25 K, 30 K, and 35 K). The initial magnetization curve deviates from straight line in 4 G at 5 K, 3.5 G at 10 K, 3 G at 15 K, 2 G at 20 K, and 1 G at 25 K. This is the narrow region that full Meiss- ner signals are detected and is roughly corresponding to the anisotropic lower critical field in the ab-plane B ab c1 (T) with B ab c1 (0) ∼ 4 G. The average lower critical field B ave c1 for polycrystalline sample is determined from the peaks of initial diamagnetic magnetization curves. B c1 decreases steadily from 12 G at 5 K, 11 G at 10 K, 9 G at 15 K, 6 G at 20 K, 3 G at 25 K and below 1 G at 30 K. A sim- ple empirical parabolic fitting gives B c1 (T) = B c1 (0)[1 -(T/T 0 ) 2 ], with average B ave c1 (0) = 12 G and T 0 = 30 K (see ). Using the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau formula B ave c1 = [2B ab c1 + B c c1 ]/3, c-axis B c c1 ∼ 28 G and anisotropy parameter γ ∼ 7 is estimated. This value is close to reported anisotropic γ-value for <rs type="material">YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7</rs> where the <rs type="class">123-type</rs> structure can be written as Cu-1212 CuBa 2 YCu 2 O 7. An average penetration depth λ ave (0) = [Φ 0 /2πB ave c1 (0)] 1/2 of 520 nm was derived with esti-</p>
    <p>The lower field, low temperature superconducting phase diagram Ba(T) of <rs type="material" xml:id="x54">RuSr2GdCu2O8</rs>. mated λ ab (0) = 340 nm and λ c (0) = 2400 nm from B c c1 = Φ 0 /2πλ 2 ab and B ab c1 = Φ 0 /2πλ ab λ c , where Φ 0 is flux quantum. Since T 0 = 30 K is well below <rs type="tc">T c (onset)</rs> = <rs corresp="#x54" type="tcValue">56 K</rs> and <rs type="tc">T c (zero)</rs> = <rs corresp="#x54" type="tcValue">39 K</rs> in zero applied field, a spontaneous vor- tex state (SVS) indeed exists between 30 K and 56 K. The low field phase diagram B a (T) for polycrystalline sample is shown in , with the average B c1 (T) sep- arates the Meissner state from the vortex state and a smaller B ab c1 (T) inside the Meissner region for reference. <rs type="tc">T c (zero)</rs> = <rs type="tcValue">39 K</rs> in the broad <rs type="tc">resistive transition</rs> is the onset of vortex depinning by driving current. This tem- perature is very close to the melting transition tempera- ture T m from the spontaneous vortex glass or lattice state to the spontaneous liquid state due to nonzero dipole field B dipole of weak-ferromagnetic order. The upper critical field B c2 defined from <rs type="tc">T c (onset)</rs> and the vortex melting field B m (T) defined from <rs type="tc">T c (zero)</rs> are temperature inde- pendent for small applied fields below 20 G. The inter- nal dipole field generated by a weak-ferromagnetic order can be estimated using a simple extrapolation [B c1 (0)+ B dip ]/B c1 (0) = T c /T 0 = 56 K/30 K, which results with a dipole field B dipole ∼ 10.4 G on the CuO 2 bi-layers. A small net spontaneous magnetic moment µ s of ∼ 0.11 µ B per Ru is estimated using B dipole ∼ 2µ s /d 3 with d = c/2 = 0.58 nm is the distance between midpoint of CuO 2 bi-layers and two nearest-neighbor Ru moments. If the weak-ferromagnetic structure is a canted G-type antiferromagnetic order with Ru moments µ (= 1.5 µ B for Ru 5+ in t 2g states) canted along the tetragonal basal plane, the small net spontaneous magnetic moment gives a canting angle of 4 • from the tetragonal c-axis and is difficult to be detected in neutron diffraction with a res- olution around 0.1 µ B . 9,10,21</p>
    <p>At 5 K, the shape of superconducting hysteresis loop with a large remanent molar magnetization M r of 83 G.cm 3 /mol indicates strong pinning as well as a good indication of bulk nature of superconductivity for the oxygen-annealed sample. The remanent M r decreases</p>

Fluctuation in the hysteresis loop is probably also related to the weak-ferromagnetic order.</p>
    <p>To study the high-field effect on superconductivity, the magnetoresistivity ρ(T,B a ) for <rs type="material" xml:id="x65">RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8</rs> up to 7 T are collectively shown in . The broadening of <rs type="tc">resis- tive transition</rs> in magnetic fields is the common features for all high-T c <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductors. The normal state <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x16-60">resistivity</rs> is field independent and follows a T 2 - dependence below T C , with superconducting <rs type="tc">T c (onset)</rs> of <rs corresp="#x65,#x16-60" type="tcValue">56 K</rs> in zero field decreases slightly to 53 K in 7-T field. The temperature dependence of upper critical field</p>
    <p>B c2 (T) can be fitted with a linear function B c2 (0)[1 -T/T c ] with average B c2 (0) = 133 T. 47 An average co- herence length ξ ave 0 = [Φ 0 /2πB ave c2 (0)] 1/2 of 0.5 nm with the Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ of 1040 and the ther- modynamic critical field B c (0) = (B c1 .B c2 ) 1/2 = 0.32 T. No anisotropic ξ ab and ξ c values can be estimated from present data. The <rs type="tc">T c (zero)</rs> decreases from <rs corresp="#x65,#x16-60" type="tcValue">39 K</rs> in zero applied field to 32 K in 1-kG, 28 K in 5-kG, 25 K in 1-T, 22 K in 2-T, 19 K in 3-T, 17 K in 4-T, 16 K in 5-T, 15 K in 6-T, and 14 K in 7-T field. If the <rs type="tc">zero resistivity</rs> is taken as the lower bound of the vortex melting tempera- ture T m , then the temperature dependence of the vortex melting transition line B m (T) can be fitted roughly by the formula B m (T) = B m (0)[1 -T/T m ] 3.5 with B m (0) = 35 T and large exponent 3.5. In the lower field region, B m (T) rises as [1 -T/T m ] 2 as predicted by the mean-field approximation for temperature near T m = 39 K. 47 The full phase diagram B a (T) of <rs type="material">RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8</rs> is shown in to exhibit both high field and low field features. The very broad vortex liquid region with ∆T = 17 K in zero field and ∆T = 42 K in 7-T field is extraordi- nary and is most likely originated from the coexistence and the interplay between superconductivity and weak- ferromagnetic order. This magnetic order is so weak that superconductivity can coexist with the magnetic order, but the effect of a weak spontaneous magnetic moment</p>
    <p>Full phase diagram Ba(T) of <rs type="material">RuSr2GdCu2O8</rs>.</p>
    <p>Field dependence of magnetoresistivity ρ(Ba) for <rs type="material">RuSr2GdCu2O8</rs> in the vortex state at 20 K, 30 K, and 40 K. µ s ∼ 0.1 µ B is detected through the appearance of a spontaneous vortex state above 30 K with a broad spon- taneous vortex liquid region above T m of 39 K.</p>
    <p>To study the broad vortex liquid region, the isother- mal field-dependent magnetoresistivity ρ(B a ) for T &lt; T c are shown in , where <rs type="tc">zero resistivity</rs> gives a lower bound of vortex melting field B m . In the resistive vortex liquid region, there is no unique power-law fit, but the data can be roughly fitted with various powers between 1/6 and 1, depending on temperature range. At T = 40 K &gt; T m = 39 K, <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> is ∼ B 1/6 a for B a &gt; 2 T and gradually changes to ∼ B 1/3 a below 1 T. At 30 K with B m = 0.2 T, <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> ∼ B 2/3 a for B a &gt; 2 T and gradu- ally changes to linear B a below 1 T. At 20 K with B m ∼ 2.4 T, similar linear variation of <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> with B a was observed for B a &gt; 3.5 T.</p>
    <p>The last issue to be addressed is the <rs type="tc">depression of T c</rs> by small spontaneous Ru magnetic moments. The weak-ferromagnetic order is actually a canted antiferro- magnetic order that can coexist with superconductivity. However, the observed <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs type="tcValue">56 K</rs> is too low as compared with <rs corresp="#x80" type="tcValue">93 K</rs> for <rs type="material" xml:id="x80">YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7</rs> or <rs corresp="#x82" type="tcValue">103 K</rs> for <rs type="material" xml:id="x82">TlBa 2 CaCu 2 O 7</rs> . The <rs type="tc">depression of T c</rs> by small spontaneous magnetic moment can be partially recovered by substitution of nonmagnetic Cu ions at Ru site. For example, in the <rs type="material">Ru 1−x Cu x Sr 2 GdCu 2 O 8</rs> system, <rs type="tc">T c onset</rs> up to <rs corresp="#x87" type="tcValue">65 K</rs> for <rs type="material" xml:id="x87">x = 0.1</rs> and <rs corresp="#x89" type="tcValue">72 K</rs> for <rs type="material" xml:id="x89">x = 0.4</rs> was reported.</p>
    <p>The lower critical field with B c1 (0) = 12 G and T 0 = 30 K indicates the existence of a spontaneous vortex state (SVS) between 30 K and <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs type="tcValue">56 K</rs>. This SVS state is closely related with the weak-ferromagnetic order with a net spontaneous magnetic moment of ∼ 0.1 µ B per Ru. The broad vortex liquid region observed above vortex melting line B m (T) is also due to the coexistence and the interplay between superconductivity and weak- ferromagnetic order.</p>
