            <p>The structure of superconducting La,CuO,o, has been determined by single- crystal neutron diffraction data. The excess oxygen, 0 4 , is located between two adjacent La01 layers. The presence of 04 distorts the apical-oxygen 01 sublattice in such that each 0 4 forms a short bond (1.64A) with one 01, which indicates the formation of a strong covalent bond between these two atoms. The Cu and 0 2 sublattices as well as that of La are not affected by 0 4 , however, 1.6% of the La cations increase their coordination from 9 to 10.</p>

      <p>It is well established today that <rs type="material">La2Cu04</rs> becomes supercon- ducting with <rs type="tc">Tc</rs>'s between <rs type="tcValue">28 K and 40 K</rs> either by cation doping on the La-sites or by raising the oxygen content to more than 4. The superconducting properties of "undoped" <rs type="material">La2Cu04</rs>, synthesized under high oxygen pressure, were first reported by . This publication was followed by several others on <rs type="material">undoped La2Cu04</rs> samples synthesized under slightly different oxygen-rich conditions [2, 31. Samples of <rs type="material">La2Cu04+6</rs> with somewhat appreciable Meissner effects were obtained reproducibly by and by , who carried out the synthesis under high oxygen pressure (a few kbar) at high temperature (500-8OOOC).</p>
      <p>Because of the uncertainties about the position and the bonding of the excess oxygen in superconducting <rs type="material">La2Cu04+</rs>, samples, we have carried out the crystal structure determi- nation of a superconducting <rs type="material" xml:id="x8">La2Cu04,032</rs> single crystal by neutron diffraction data taken at room temperature and 15K.</p>
      <p>The crystal was grown in a CuO flux [4]. It was then treated at 500Â°C under oxygen pressure (pOz = 3 kbar) for 62 h and cooled slowly to room temperature.</p>
      <p>The <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs> for the single crystal was obtained by a.c. <rs type="me_method">susceptibility measurements</rs>. The volume of the superconducting phase was estimated to be about 70% with an <rs type="tc">onset</rs> at <rs corresp="#x8" type="tcValue">37.5K</rs> .</p>
      <p>The neutron diffraction intensities were collected at room temperature and 15 K using the D-9 four-circle diffracto- meter at the ILL reactor (A = 0.484 17 A). The intensities of ten of the strongest reflections were measured every 5K on both side of the <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs>. No measurable change, indicating a structural transition, was detected. The crystal was twinned but the systematic abscences of the space group Cmca allowed the determination of the percentage of each individual in the crystal (a value of 0.46 was obtained in the final refinement).</p>
      <p>The refinement of the cation sites occupancy indicates that the La/Cu ratio is exactly 2 in this crystal. Since the cation lattices do not compromise any vacancies, the structure must contain an excess oxygen. We chose to localize this oxygen excess from crystal chemical considerations (analogy to the structure of <rs type="material">La2Ni04+</rs>, [6]) and then try to refine its position (1/4 y 1/4). We used the low temperature data because in this case the thermal effects are minimized.</p>
      <p>We found an excess oxygen 0 4 at x = 1/4, y = 0.243, z = 1/4 with a population p 0 4 = 0.016(2). We found also that the site 0 3 at x = 0.031(5), y = 0.182(2), z = 0.101(5) was occupied with a population p03 = 0.023(2) x 2. Since this position is just 0.75 8, from that of 01 (apical oxygen of the octahedron) it can only be occupied when 01 is empty. Therefore 0 3 should be interpreted as the result of displace- ments of some of the 0 1 anions. Very likely, the excess oxygen 0 4 is responsible for these displacements. From the ratio of the occupancy factors of 0 3 and 0 4 , it can be deduced that for each 0 4 three 0 1 are displaced to 0 3 .</p>
      <p>The results based on the 15 K data after the final refine- ment are reported in . The results based on the room temperature data were in agreement with the low temperature ones.</p>
      <p>The structure of <rs type="material">La2Cu04</rs>, is schematized in . For clarity only half cell ( 4 2 x b x c/2) is shown. The Cu cations are located at the center of apically-elongated octahedra. The Cu02, layers are separated from each other by two LaOl layers. The excess oxygen 0 4 atoms are located between two LaOl layers, at the center of cubes whose corners are occu- pied by four La and four 01 atoms. Each time that an 0 4 site is occupied, four La cations become ten coordinated, but their position is not affected. On the contrary, as stated above, this excess oxygen brings about the displacement of the 01 atoms toward the 0 3 sites. The list of all poss- ible 01-04, 03-04 distances is: 0 1 -0 4 = 2.19(2)A x 2, Ix as. Susceptibility of the La,CuO, single crystal used for neutron diffraction.</p>
      <p>If each 0 4 is surrounded by three 0 3 and one 01, as the ratio of the occupancy factors seems to indicate, one of the 03-04 distances must be 1.64 A, the other three being either 04-01 = 2.198, and 04-03 = 2.61 x 2, or 04-01 = 2.198, and 04-03 = 2.438, x 2. The short distance (1.64 8,) is indicative of a strong covalent bond and corresponds to the formation of an (O,)-, peroxide grouping. The values found in peroxide compounds such as BaO, is about 1., whereas the 0-0 distance corre- sponding to a superoxide (02)-' grouping found in com- pounds such as KOz and CsO, is 1.38, .</p>
      <p>The present structural study shows that each 0 4 atom forms an Oz grouping with one 03. Since the formal valence of such grouping is taken at -2, the oxygen doping does not bring about any change in the formal cation valence. For every 0 4 that enters the structure as -1, one 0 3 decreases its valence from -2 to -1.</p>
      <p>shows a projection of five unit cells of the LaZCuO, structure on the ac plane. Only La, 01, 0 3 and 0 4 are shown. The introduction of 0 4 has a double effect on the La coordination: on one hand it increases the coordi- nation of the four first nearest La neighbours (La,-, in Fig. 3) and on the other it causes the variation of some of the nine La-0 distances for ten La cations, namely the four first Physica Scripta T29 Fig. 2.

The displaced 0 4 atoms to the 0 3 positions are indicated. nearest neighbours and six second-nearest ones (La,-, in the same figure). It is not too meaningful to discuss formal valences when the compound contains strong covalent bonds between 0 La Fig. 3. A projection on the ax. plane of five orthorhombic unit cells. Only the La, 01, 03, 04 of half unit cell (a x b/2 x c) are represented. anions as in the case of <rs type="material">La2Cu04,032</rs>. However, qualitatively it can be stated that the increase of the coordination number of some of the La cations and the readjustment of the corre- sponding La-0 distances, should correspond to a readjust- ment of the electrostatic charges around the La cations. La valence calculations using the Zachariasen formula indicate an average total increase of 0.3 V.U. Since the Cu sublattice is only slightly affected by the introduction of 04, all the cation valence increase occurs on the La sublattice. When the struc- ture of YBa,Cu,O, was determined in detail it was reasonable to attribute the extra charge to the Cu sublattice, but, as indicated later by NMR, EXAFS, and XPS measurements, it actually corresponds to holes in the oxygen 2p band. In the present case as well the cation charge excess could be the result of holes in the same band.</p>
      <p>The above discussion is valid only for a model where the distortion induced by a given 0 4 does not overlap with that induced by one of the adjacent 04. If these atoms are distri- buted isotropically in the structure, then one every eighth cell contains an 0 4 and the corresponding distortion. Conse- quently, there are not large 04-free areas.</p>
      <p>Jorgensen et al. have shown that at 320K a phase separation occurs. From their data they argue that one phase is superconducting while the other is not. The powder pattern can only be indexed on two sets of lattice parameters: the a and b values are identical for the two sets while the two c values differ of about 1/5 x (a-c). The single-crystal and the powder diffraction data could be reconciled if one assumes that the 0 4 atoms are in some way more clustered together than described above. The superconducting samples would be comprosed of two types of domains, one with the 0 4 excess and the other without and these domains would be larger than the diffraction correlation length.</p>
      <p>Because of our experimental conditions (short wavelength) we could not possibly detect the phase separation, even if present in our sample. Neutron diffraction work on crystals exhibiting better Meissner effect than that of the present crystal, and using a longer wavelength is in progress.</p>
