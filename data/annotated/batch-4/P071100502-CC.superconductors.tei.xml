          <p>We use neutron scattering to demonstrate that electron-doped superconducting <rs type="material">Pr 0.88 LaCe 0.12 CuO 4-δ</rs> in the underdoped regime is electronically phase separated in the ground state, showing the coexistence of a superconducting phase with a three- dimensional antiferromagnetically ordered phase and a quasi-two-dimensional spin density wave modulation. The Néel temperature of both antiferromagnetic phases decreases linearly with increasing <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs> (<rs type="tc">T c</rs> ) and vanishes when optimal superconductivity is achieved. These results indicate that the electron-doped <rs type="class">copper oxides</rs> are close to a quantum critical point, where the delicate energetic balance between different competing states leads to microscopic heterogeneity.</p>

    <p>One of the most important unresolved problems in high-transition temperature (high-T c ) superconductors is the determination of the microscopic state when charge carriers, either holes or electrons, are introduced to the CuO 2 planes of their insulating long-range antiferromagnetically ordered parent compounds . One school of thought suggests that the doped charge carriers segregate into inhomogeneous patterns, such as stripes, to allow the antiferromagnetic (AF) regions to survive . In this picture, the observed quasi two-dimensional (2D) incommensurate spin density wave (SDW) in hole-doped high-T c superconductors, such as <rs type="material">La 2-x Sr x CuO 4</rs> (3) and <rs type="material">La 2 CuO 4+δ</rs> (4), is due to remnants of the AF insulating phase that compete with superconductivity (SC) . Alternatively, carrier doping into the CuO 2 planes may evolve the system through a quantum phase transition (QPT) between competing ordered and disordered phases . While much is unknown about these competing phases and their relationship to SC, the presence of such a QPT has been reported in both hole-doped and electron- doped (12) materials.</p>
    <p>In this paper, we use neutron scattering to demonstrate that the AF to SC transition in <rs type="material">electron-doped Pr 0.88 LaCe 0.12 CuO 4-δ (PLCCO)</rs> is close to a QPT (13) and the proximity to such a QPT leads to an inhomogeneous electronic state due to competing order parameters . Specifically, we find that when SC first appears in <rs type="material">PLCCO</rs> with increasing doping, a quasi-2D commensurate SDW modulation is also induced, and both coexist with the three-dimensional (3D) AF state. The Néel temperature (T N ) of both the 2D and 3D AF phases decreases linearly with increasing <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and vanishes when optimal SC is achieved . Combined with earlier reports , our discovery establishes that the quasi-2D SDW modulation and its associated electronic inhomogeneity are general features of charge-carrier-doped <rs type="class">copper oxides</rs>. Such microscopic heterogeneity naturally results from the competition of different order parameters near a QPT. Traditionally, the transition from AF to SC in <rs type="class">copper oxides</rs> is achieved by chemical doping, which also introduces additional complications such as structural and/or chemical disorder that may mask the nature of the transition . We choose to study this transition in <rs type="material">electron-doped PLCCO</rs> because, as-grown, these materials are nonsuperconducting (NSC) AF insulators and SC can be achieved by only annealing the samples with minor oxygen modification that changes the charge carrier density . While recent neutron scattering experiments on superconducting <rs type="material">Nd 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 4 (NCCO)</rs> show a drastic suppression of the static 3D AF order, how SC is established is unknown in part because the magnetic nature of the Nd 3+ in <rs type="material">NCCO</rs> complicates the interpretation of the data . A systematic investigation on single crystals of <rs type="material">PLCCO</rs>, where the Pr 3+ has a nonmagnetic singlet ground state , should shed new light on our understanding of the transition from the AF to SC.</p>
    <p>We grew single crystals of <rs type="material">PLCCO</rs> (mosaicity &lt; 1º, cylindrical rods Ø5 mm by~20 mm) using the traveling solvent floating zone technique (22). As-grown, the <rs type="material">PLCCO crystals</rs> are not superconducting and exhibit the noncollinear AF structure of <rs type="material">undoped Pr 2 CuO 4</rs> (due to the weak pseudodipolar exchange interaction between Cu and Pr . By annealing the samples at different temperatures in pure Ar, we obtain bulk superconducting <rs type="material">PLCCO</rs> with different <rs type="tc">T c</rs> 's and therefore control the transition from the AF state to the superconducting state . <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x17">Magnetic susceptibility</rs> measurements on our <rs type="material" xml:id="x18">PLCCO crystals</rs> show the <rs type="tc">onset of bulk SC</rs>, which corresponds to zero resistivity, at <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x17,#x18" type="tcValue">24 K</rs>, <rs corresp="#x18" type="tcValue">21 K</rs>, and <rs corresp="#x18" type="tcValue">16 K</rs>, respectively .</p>
    <p>We used elastic neutron scattering to probe AF order and label the momentum transfer Q = (q x , q y , q z ) as (H, K, L) = (q x a/2π, q y a/2π, q z c/2π) in the reciprocal lattice</p>
    <p>units (rlu) appropriate for the tetragonal unit cell of <rs type="material">PLCCO</rs> (space group I4/mmm, a = 3.98 and c = 12.27 Å). Experiments were performed in [H, K, 0] and [H, H, L] zones 4 using triple-axis spectroscopy. In the latter geometry we also probed the 2D magnetic scattering using a two-axis energy integration mode .</p>
    <p>The magnetic Bragg peaks can be used to determine the size and temperature dependence of the ordered Cu (and Pr, if they are significant) moments, and summarizes the experiments in the [H, K, 0] plane for the four samples investigated.</p>
    <p>Because of the c-axis spin-spin coupling, the magnetic scattering of the noncollinear AF structure is nonzero at (0.5,1.5,0), but vanishes at (0.5, 0.5, 0) (. The annealing process necessary for producing SC also induces a small (~0.9%) epitaxial secondary impurity phase, <rs type="material">cubic (Nd,Ce) 2 O 3</rs> in the case of <rs type="material">Nd 2-x Ce x CuO 4</rs> and <rs type="material">(Pr,La,Ce) 2 O 3</rs> for <rs type="material">PLCCO</rs>, which has Bragg peaks at (0.5,0.5,0) and</p>
    <p>. For the optimally doped (<rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x29" type="tcValue">24 K</rs>) sample, neither peak shows any temperature dependence, suggesting no magnetic component. Scans along (0.5,0.5,L) through L = 1, 3 where magnetic peaks are expected also found no evidence of static AF order (Figs. 3a and 3b), consistent with the phase diagram of <rs type="material" xml:id="x29">Pr 1-x LaCe x CuO 4-δ</rs> (18). For the underdoped superconducting samples, on cooling to 5 K the intensity increases for the (0.5,1.5,0) magnetic Bragg peak (Figs. 2f and 2g) as expected.</p>
    <p>Assuming that the residual AF structure in superconducting <rs type="material" xml:id="x11-9">PLCCO</rs> is identical to that of the <rs type="material">as-grown PLCCO</rs>, we estimate that the effective static low-temperature Cu ordered moment (M cu ) reduces from 0.06 B µ to 0.04 B µ (with no appreciable induced Pr moment) when <rs type="tc">T c</rs> increases <rs corresp="#x11-9" type="tcValue">from 16 K to 21 K</rs> . Concomitantly, T N of the system decreases from 60 K to 40 K . For comparison, we cut a piece off the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x11-9" type="tcValue">16 K</rs> crystal and quenched SC by annealing it in air at for 24 hours . In this <rs type="material">NSC PLCCO</rs> sample, the T N becomes 186 K and M cu is 0.12 900 C B µ at 97 K. In the underdoped samples, we also observed magnetic intensity at the (0.5,0.5,0) peak . The temperature dependence of the scattering at (0.5,0.5,0) and</p>
    <p>the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x11-9" type="tcValue">21 K</rs> and <rs corresp="#x11-9" type="tcValue">16 K</rs> crystals is quite similar (Figs. 3c-f), and thus suggests at first glance that they are both related to the onset of 3D AF order. However, equivalent scans in the [H, H, L] scattering plane indicate that the two types of peaks must have a different origin. In particular, while both (limited in the CuO 2 plane (Figs. 2b, 2c, 2f, 2g), a scan along the L- direction of (0.5,0.5,0) in the [H, H, L] zone at 6 K shows only slightly enhanced "background" scattering compared to the 80 K data on the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x11-9" type="tcValue">16 K</rs> crystal (Fig. 4a). Scans along the (0.5,0.5,L) direction find no appreciable differences between 6 K and 60 K except at (0.5,0.5,1), where the long-range 3D AF order develops (Figs. 4b and 4c). Measurements at the (shown), on the other hand, confirm quantitatively that the magnetic structure is indeed that of Fig. 1a with a T K and negligible induced Pr moment. 60 N ≈ The scattering associated with the (0.5,0.5,0) peak therefore appears to be diffuse and quasi 2D along the c-axis direction (29). To test if this is indeed the case, we carried out measurements in the two-axis energy-integrated mode by aligning the outgoing wavevector k f parallel to the 2D rod direction . In this geometry, we measure the wave-vector-dependent <rs type="me_method">susceptibility</rs> that includes the elastic scattering around (0.5,0.5,L) with 0.4 &lt; L &lt;0.6 (see magenta areas in . The data reveal an unambiguous peak centered at (0.5,0.5, L) whose intensity decreases with increasing temperature . This and measurements around (0.5,0.5,0) suggest that (0.5,0.5,L) is weakly L-dependent. Therefore, <rs type="material">underdoped PLCCO</rs> has a quasi-2D SDW modulation ) that coexists with SC and 3D AF order.</p>
    <p>The relation between <rs type="tc">T c</rs> 's and T N 's of our <rs type="material">PLCCO crystals</rs> is summarized in , which demonstrates that T N decreases linearly with increasing <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and vanishes when optimal superconductivity is established. While these results suggest the presence of a QPT to SC when T N approaches zero, how do we understand the coexistence of quasi-2D SDW and long-range 3D AF order and their relationship to SC?</p>
    <p>One concern might be that the annealing process necessary for producing SC in <rs type="material">PLCCO</rs> causes macroscopic oxygen inhomogeneities, giving rise to separate nonmagnetic SC and AF NSC phases. In this scenario one would expect to observe both a sharp <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and a robust T N weakly depending on oxygen doping as in the case of <rs type="material">oxygen-doped La 2 CuO 4</rs> . However, the drastic decrease in 3D transition to long range magnetic order (T N decreasing from 186 K for NSC to 40 K for <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x14-201" type="tcValue">21 K</rs> sample) combined with relatively sharp magnetic transition [as in <rs type="material">hole-doped La 2 CuO 4</rs> demonstrates that this is not the case. The relatively broad SC transition is then a consequence of an intrinsic electronic inhomogeneity occurring on a length scale longer than the (short) SC coherence length. While neutrons are a bulk probe and cannot determine how SC coexists with the AF phases at zero-field, magnetic field experiments show that the AF phase competes directly with SC . In this case, the observed commensurate quasi-2D SDW in <rs type="material" xml:id="x14-201">PLCCO</rs> is analogous to the incommensurate 2D SDW in <rs type="material">hole-doped La 2-x Sr x CuO 4</rs> and <rs type="material">La 2 CuO 4+δ</rs> . In the electron-doped case, the commensurate SDW may arise from the in-phase domains of "stripes" (22), as compared to the anti-phase domains of "stripes" in hole-doped materials . While a detailed picture of <rs type="material">PLCCO</rs> may be obtained from future spin dynamical measurements, it appears that microscopic heterogeneity and the resulting competition of different order parameters are general features of doped <rs type="class">copper oxides</rs> near a QPT .</p>
