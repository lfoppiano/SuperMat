          <p>In this paper, the F e-containing superconductors <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> , <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> and <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Sr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> were successfully prepared by common solid-state reaction followed with a procedure of high pressure synthesis. The structural change and superconducting properties in <rs type="material">(F e x Cu 1−x )BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ (x = 0 ∼ 1.0)</rs> systems were also investigated.

    <body>
      <p>It is well known that <rs type="material">Y Ba 2 (Cu 1−x M x ) 3 O 6+δ (M = F e and Co)</rs> systems (We de- note it as <rs type="material">(F e x Cu 1−x )Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> ) have been extensively investigated for providing in- formation about the mechanism of superconductivity and understanding the correlation among superconductivity, magnetism and crystal structure in high temperature ceramic superconductors. The main conclusions concerning its crystal structure and superconducting properties are as follows:</p>
        <p>In <rs type="material">undoped Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ</rs> superconductor, there are two different structural Cu sites: Cu(1) and Cu(2). The Cu(1) site has a square planar oxygen coordination and forms Cu −O chain, and the Cu(2) site has a five fold pyramidal coordination of oxygen and forms CuO 2 plane. There is strong evidence from neutron diffraction results that Cu(1) sites are the preferred occupation sites for F e and Co atoms in substituted <rs type="material">(F e x Cu 1−x )Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> compound.</p>
      <p>Neutron and X-Ray diffraction analysis indicate that <rs type="material">(F e x Cu 1−x )Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> undergoes a structural phase transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal at <rs type="material">F e concentration x ∼ 0.12−0.15</rs> . Electron microscopy observations indicate that the microstructure of <rs type="material">(F e x Cu 1−x )Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> evolves as the F e concentration changes .</p>
      <p>The <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs> <rs type="tc">T c</rs>, decreases with the increasing F e concentration x, when <rs type="material">x exceeds 0.3</rs>, <rs type="tc">superconductivity disappears</rs> completely.</p>
      <p>The oxygen content, 7 + δ, in <rs type="material">(F e x Cu 1−x )Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs>, increases with the in- creasing F e concentration due to the higher valence of F e.</p>
        <p>In previous studies, several groups have reported superconductivity in <rs type="material">Y Sr 2 Cu 3−x M x O 6+δ compounds with F e (or Co) light-substitution</rs>, but the <rs type="material">heavily- substituted compounds (x &gt; 0.3)</rs> did <rs type="tc">not exhibit superconductivity</rs>. T. Denetial observed <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ∼ <rs corresp="#x18" type="tcValue">30−50K</rs> in <rs type="material" xml:id="x18">F e(Co or T i)-doped R-123 phase Y Sr 2 F e x Cu 1−x O 6+δ with x = 0.3</rs>, while <rs type="material">x &gt; 0.3</rs>, <rs type="tc">superconductivity could not be ob- served</rs>. F. Shi et al. improved the superconductivity of <rs type="material" xml:id="x21">Y Sr 2 Cu 2.7 F e 0.3 O 7+δ</rs> compound by high-pressure oxygen annealing, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> reaches <rs corresp="#x21" type="tcValue">60K</rs> and a shielding fraction of nearly 100% is achieved. Recently J. Shimoyama et al. prepared <rs type="material" xml:id="x24">F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> superconductor with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ∼ <rs corresp="#x24" type="tcValue">60K</rs> using a complex synthesis procedure and T. Mochiku et al. determined the crys- tal structure of this superconductor by neutron powder diffraction studies. Besides, some <rs type="material">BaR(Cu 0.5+x F e 0.5−x ) 2 O 5+δ (R = Y , Sm)</rs> , <rs type="material">Bi 2 Sr 3 F e 2 O x</rs> , <rs type="material">BaY CuF eO 5</rs> 33 , etc. have also been reported, but none of these compounds is superconducting.</p>
        <p>We have prepared a <rs type="class">F e-containing cuprate</rs> superconductor <rs type="material" xml:id="x31">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ∼ <rs corresp="#x31" type="tcValue">77K</rs> in year 2000 by solid-state reaction and high pressure synthesis.</p>
        <p>The preliminary results of this superconductor have been reported . After that, the studies of F e-containing superconductors were developed and new superconductors of <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> and <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Sr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> were successfully prepared. In this paper, the preparation, superconductivity, structure and the results related to these super- conductors are presented.</p>
        <p>The predried Y 2 O 3 , BaCO 3 , SrCO 3, F e 2 O 3 , and CuO powders of 99.99% purity were used as the starting materials. The powders with the stoichiometric composition of <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 (Ba 1−x Sr x ) 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ (x = 0, 0.5, and 1.0)</rs> were mixed, ground thoroughly and calcined twice at 925 o C for 60 hours in air with intermediate grinding. The products were pressed into pellets, and calcined again at 925 o C for 60 hours and cooled down to room temperature at the rate of 30 o C per hour in air. These samples prepared by the common solid-state reaction procedure were labeled as AM-sample. The AM-sample powders were oxygenated under high pressure of 6GPa at 1000 o C for 0.5 hour by the addition of 5wt.% KClO 4 (which was used as an oxygen source) in a six-anvil of tungsten carbide high pressure apparatus. Samples were quenched from high temperature quickly by cutting off the furnace power before releasing the high pressure . These samples were labeled as HP-sample.</p>
        <p>The phase and structure of these samples were characterized by powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis on an MXP 18A−HF type diffractometer with Cu-K α radiation. All inves- tigated samples exhibited single phase diagram. P owderX, F inax and Rietweld programs were used for lattice parameter calculations. The data of <rs type="me_method">DC magnetization</rs> and <rs type="me_method">electrical resistance</rs> were measured using a DC-SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS 5.5T) and standard four-probe technique respectively.</p>
        <p>A. The structural change and superconductivity in <rs type="material">(F e x Cu 1−x )BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ syn- thesized by solid-state reaction under ambient pressure</rs> Fig.shows the XRD patterns of the <rs type="material">(F e x Cu 1−x )BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ systems of AM-samples (x = 0∼1.0)</rs>, indicating that all samples are of single phase. Fig. shows the changes of lattice parameters. With the increasing of F e concentration x, lattice parameter a increases and b decreases, and a structural transition undergoes from orthorhombic to tetragonal at F e concentration x ∼ 0.15, afterwards lattice parameter a increases slightly. The lattice parameter c always decreases whereas unit cell volume V increases with the increasing x. Fig. shows some typical curves of <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> vs. temperature, which indicates that the substitution of F e atoms suppresses the electric conductance and <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> for the <rs type="material">AM-samples</rs>, when <rs type="material">x &gt; 0.3</rs>, all samples become <rs type="tc">non-superconducting</rs> and exhibit semi-conducting behavior in <rs type="me_method">R-T curves</rs>. The inset is the dependence of <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs> on F e content x, which displays a linear depression. These results are similar to those of <rs type="material">(F e x Cu 1−x )Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> system.</p>
        <p>B. Superconductivity of <rs type="material">(F e x Cu 1−x )BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ prepared by high pressure</rs> syn- thesis XRD patterns of <rs type="material">(F e x Cu 1−x )BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ HP-samples</rs> indicate that all samples (x varies from 0 to 1.0) are still single phase after high pressure synthesis. Fig. shows <rs type="tc">T c (onset)</rs> vs. F e concentration x and <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> vs. temperature curves obtained using ZFC mode under applied external magnetic field of 10Oe, indicating that all samples <rs type="tc">exhibit supercon- ductivity</rs> and the samples with <rs type="material">x = 0.35−0.6</rs> have relatively high <rs type="tc">superconducting transi- tion temperature</rs> <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and high superconducting volume fraction V m . Typical curves of the dependence of <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> and <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> on temperature for <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> superconductor are shown in Fig., it can be calculated from the ZFC and FC curves that the superconducting shielding volume fraction is 48% and the Meissner volume fraction is 31% at 10K by the relationship of V m = (4πρM/H), where ρ is the density of sample in g/cm 3 , M is mass magnetization in emu/g using ZFC and FC data respectively, and H is the applied magnetic field in Oe.</p>
        <p>C. <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> superconductor</p>
        <p>As mentioned previously, the <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> sample prepared by solid-state reaction in air is semi-conductor. While after high pressure synthesis, this sample <rs type="tc">becomes superconducting</rs>.</p>
        <p>Fig.6 presents the XRD patterns of the <rs type="material">AM-sample</rs> and <rs type="material">HP-sample</rs>, <rs type="me_method">R-T</rs> and <rs type="me_method">M-T</rs> curves of <rs type="material">HP-sample</rs>. The lattice parameters for <rs type="material" xml:id="x63">HP-sample</rs> are a = 0.3870(3)nm, c = 1.1601(5)nm, while for <rs type="material">AM-sample</rs>, a = 0.3871(3)nm, c = 1.1671(5)nm. From the <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x65">R-T curve</rs>, the <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs>, <rs type="tc">T c (onset)</rs> is found at <rs corresp="#x63,#x65" type="tcValue">83K</rs> and <rs type="tc">T c (zero)</rs> is at <rs corresp="#x63,#x65" type="tcValue">63K</rs>. From the ZFC and FC curves it can be calculated that the superconducting shielding volume fraction is 55% and the Meissner volume fraction is 22% at 10K.</p>
        <p>D. <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Sr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> superconductor</p>
        <p>The synthesis and crystal structure of <rs type="material">F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> superconductor have been reported by J. Shimoyama et al. and T. Mochiku et al . This suggests that <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Sr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> superconductor might be obtained. It has been known that <rs type="class">R-123</rs> or <rs type="class">1212</rs> phase can not be prepared by solid-state reaction under ambient pressure in <rs type="class">R-Sr-Cu-O systems</rs>. However, in <rs type="material">(F e x Cu 1−x )Sr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> system, single phase of <rs type="material">(Cu,Fe)- 1212</rs> phase can be obtained because this phase can be stabilized by the substitution of F e for Cu.</p>
        <p>The <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Sr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> sample prepared under ambient pressure is <rs type="tc">not supercon- ducting</rs>, but after high pressure synthesis, the sample becomes superconducting. This sug- gests that the origin of superconductivity in <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Sr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> is similar to that in <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> and <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> superconductors of HP-samples. XRD patterns and <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x83">M-T curve</rs> of <rs type="material" xml:id="x84">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Sr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> superconductor are shown in the <rs type="tc">T c (onset)</rs> is about <rs corresp="#x83,#x84" type="tcValue">77K</rs>, and the sample is nearly single phase. The lattice pa-rameters for <rs type="material">HP-sample</rs> are a = 0.3859(4)nm, c = 1.1602(5)nm, while for <rs type="material">AM-sample</rs>, a = 0.3871(3)nm, c = 1.1669(5)nm.</p>
        <p>E. The annealing experiments of <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> superconductor</p>
        <p>The oxygen content in the <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> samples prepared by solid-state reaction under ambient pressure and high pressure synthesis were determined by a volumetric method . The principle of this method is to dissolve the sample in diluted hydrochloric acid, according to the liberated oxygen volume, the oxygen content is calculated. The obtained results are: 7+δ = 7.20(2) in <rs type="material">AM-sample</rs> and 7+δ = 7.35(2) in <rs type="material">HP-sample</rs>. This indicates clearly that the oxygen content is increased by high pressure synthesis. A superconducting <rs type="material" xml:id="x93">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> sample with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ∼ <rs corresp="#x93" type="tcValue">60K</rs> was annealed in air at 210, 290 400, 500, 700, 900 and 950 o C for 2 hours step by step.</p>
    <p>Fig. shows the <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> vs. temperature curves of the <rs type="material">annealed F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ HP-sample</rs>, indicating that the <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs> <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and superconducting volume fraction decrease rapidly with the increase of annealing temperature, and the sample became non-superconducting when annealing temperature were higher than 500 o C, and even after annealed under as low as 290 o C, superconductivity in this sample was almost destroyed completely. The results of the <rs type="material">annealed F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> superconductor are similar to these results, which are shown in Fig.).</p>
        <p>Fig.shows the local region XRD patterns (46 o ∼48 o in 2θ) of the <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ AM-sample</rs> and the <rs type="material">annealed HP-sample</rs> at different tem- peratures. After high pressure synthesis, the peaks of (006) and (200) shift to high angle degree and overlap each other, and with the increase of annealing temperature, the peaks shift to low angle degree again. When the annealing temperature is higher than 400 o C, the positions of the peaks are nearly constant within experimental error, indicating that lattice parameters a and c stop increasing. It means that the extra oxygen introduced by high pressure synthesis is liberated almost completely at 400 o C. As a result, the annealed sample becomes non-superconducting. When temperature is higher than 500 o C, the main role of the annealing is the improvement of lattice distortion, homogenizing and the increase of crystal grain size, which makes the peaks narrower and makes (006) and (200) peaks gradually apart from each other.</p>
        <p>A well-known fact in <rs type="class">R-123</rs> phase superconductors is that the superconductors with higher oxygen content have smaller lattice parameters a and c. This phenomenon was also observed in the <rs type="material">Y Sr 2 Cu 2.7 F e 0.3 O 7+δ</rs> superconductor and in <rs type="material">F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> superconductor ob- tained by high oxygen pressure synthesis. In these superconductors, the diffraction peaks of (006) and (200) shift systematically to higher angle degree with the increase of oxygen content, which is similar to our results. All our <rs type="material">HP-samples</rs> have smaller lattice parameters a and c than the corresponding <rs type="material">AM-samples</rs>, and the lattice unit cell of <rs type="material">HP-samples</rs> displays an obvious shrinkage. Since the relative shrinkage is not more bigger than other samples an- nealed under high oxygen pressure, and also for that <rs type="material">F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> sample can be made superconducting without high pressure synthesis, thereby this shrinkage can be attributed to the increase of oxygen content, but not the pressure effect caused by the high pressure synthesis procedure. Then it can be deduced that in all <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 (Ba 1−x Sr x ) 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> samples the oxygen content increased after high pressure synthesis, which is validated by the oxygen content measurement in <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> system where 7+δ increased from 7.20(2) in <rs type="material">AM-sample</rs> to 7.35(2) in <rs type="material">HP-sample</rs>. The increased oxygen content provided the required charge which made the semiconducting-like <rs type="material">AM-samples</rs> changed to supercon- ducting <rs type="material">HP-samples</rs>. The diffusion of F e atom into CuO 2 planes in <rs type="class">R-123</rs> systems is believed to be very unfavorable for superconductivity because of its magnetic moment, and with the increase of F e concentration, this diffusion is inevitable in samples synthesized by common solid-state reaction . J. Shimoyama et al. used a complex annealing procedure which is believed to suppress the incorporation of F e to the CuO 2 planes in <rs type="material" xml:id="x116">F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> system, and finally made it superconducting with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ∼ <rs corresp="#x116" type="tcValue">60K</rs>. Using neutron powder diffraction studies, T. Mochiku et al. investigated the site-mixing between F e and Cu atoms in <rs type="material">F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> samples synthesized through different procedures, and proved that simply increasing the oxygen content could <rs type="tc">not produce superconductivity</rs> and the ordered distribution of F e and Cu atoms between Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites is also one of the key points to the origin of superconductivity. In our <rs type="class">heavily F e-doped R-1212</rs> systems, high pressure synthesis procedure is believed to promote the transfer of F e atoms from Cu(2) site to Cu(1) site, and to make almost all the F e atoms to occupy the Cu(1) chain site. This redistribution of F e atoms is a needed requirement to ensure the occurrence of superconductivity, while the increase of oxygen content provides the needed amount of charge.</p>
        <p>The annealing experiments of <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> and <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> superconductors indicate clearly that the concentration of oxygen content affects supercon- ductivity in <rs type="material">HP-samples</rs> directly. Since annealed under the temperature as low as 290 o C during a short time of 2 hours, the occupation site of F e atoms could not be changed, but superconductivity in these superconductors was destroyed sharply. The local region XRD patterns in Fig.indicated that the lattice parameters increased rapidly with the increase of annealing temperature below 400 o C, which suggested the release of oxygen content, and this was the main reason for the loss of superconductivity.</p>
        <p>After the discovery of <rs type="material">F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> and <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> superconduc- tors, there is a doubt that the superconductivity in these superconductors is possibly from <rs type="material">Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ</rs> , <rs type="material">Y BaSrCu 3 O 7−δ</rs> or <rs type="material">Y Sr 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ</rs> phase formed by phase segregation. It is known that <rs type="material" xml:id="x127">Y Sr 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ</rs> superconductor with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x127" type="tcValue">30-80K</rs> can be obtained also by high pressure synthesis and its superconductivity disappears after heat treating at 300-500 o C. Although the single phase of XRD pattern results and high superconducting vol- ume fraction of these superconductors have excluded these disputes, the achievement of <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> superconductor and the similarity of its superconductivity to those of <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> and <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Sr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> superconductors eliminate this doubt. The annealing experiments also eliminate the possibility that the superconductivity in <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ HP-sample</rs> is from <rs type="material">Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ</rs> phase due to phase segrega- tion, since it is well known that the superconductivity in <rs type="material">Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ</rs> can not be destroyed by annealing at the temperature of 200-500 o C and the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs type="material" xml:id="x138">Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ</rs> obtained by high pressure synthesis is <rs corresp="#x138" type="tcValue">92K</rs>.</p>
        <p>The discovery of these heavily-substituted superconductors with magnetic metal of F e atoms provides new platforms to investigate the mechanism of high temperature supercon- ductivity and the correlation of magnetism and superconductivity, and it seems that we need to reconsider the influence of magnetism on superconductivity.</p>
    <p>Three kind of superconductors with high F e concentration <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> , <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> and <rs type="material">F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Sr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ</rs> were successfully prepared by solid- state reaction and high pressure synthesis. The high pressure synthesis resulted in the increase of oxygen content and redistribution of F e and Cu atoms between Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites, which are two key factors for the occurrence of superconductivity. The annealing experimental results indicate these clearly and eliminate the doubt of superconductivity relative to possible secondary phase of <rs type="material">Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ</rs> , <rs type="material">Y BaSrCu 3 O 7−δ</rs> or <rs type="material">Y Sr 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ</rs> superconductors.</p>
