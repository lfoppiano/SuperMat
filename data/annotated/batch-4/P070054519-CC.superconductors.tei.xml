          <p>Magnetic field dependence of <rs type="me_method">low temperature specific heat</rs> of <rs type="class">spinel oxide</rs> superconductor <rs type="material" xml:id="x6">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> has been elaborately investigated. In the normal state, the obtained electronic coefficient of <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> ã n = 19.15 mJ/mol K 2 , the Debye temperature È D = 657 K and some other parameters are compared with those reported earlier. The <rs type="tc">superconducting transition</rs> at <rs type="tc">T c</rs> <rs corresp="#x6" type="tcValue">~1 1.4 K</rs> is very sharp (∆T c ~ 0.3 K) and the estimated äC/ã n T c is ~1.78. In the <rs type="tc">superconducting</rs> state, the best fit of data leads to the electronic <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> C es /ã n T c = 9.87 exp (-1.58 T c /T) without field and ã(H) ∝ H 0.95 with fields. In addition, H c2 (0) ~ 11.7 T, H c (0)~0.32 T, ξ GL (0) ~ 55 Å , λ GL (0) ~ 1600 Å , and H c1 (0) ~ 26 mT are estimated from Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory or other relevant relations. All results from the present study indicate that <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> can be well described by a typical type-II, BCS-like, moderate coupling, and fully gapped superconductor in the dirty limit. It is further suggested that <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> is a moderately electron-electron correlated system.</p>

    <p><rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> is unique among <rs type="class">oxide</rs> superconductors in many respects like its chemistry, crystal structure and <rs type="tc">superconducting</rs> properties. In the normal spinel-like structure (space group Fd3m) of <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs>, the Li and Ti atoms are respectively at the positions of tetrahedral (8a) and octahedral (16d) sites.</p>
      <p>The <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x4-2">resistivity</rs> and <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x16">magnetic susceptibility</rs> data of <rs type="material" xml:id="x17">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> showed the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ~ <rs corresp="#x4-2,#x16,#x17" type="tcValue">10-12 K</rs>. The <rs type="tc">disappearance of superconductivity</rs> in <rs type="material">Li 1+x Ti 2-x O 4</rs> for <rs type="material">x &gt; 0.15</rs> was concluded to be due to grain boundary effects. It has attracted a lot of attentions due to at least having the following physical significances related to the present studies. For example, it is the only <rs type="class">spinel oxide</rs> superconductor (<rs type="tc">T c</rs> <rs type="tcValue">~1 2 K</rs>) so far to our knowledge. Also, it is the rare <rs type="class">oxide</rs> superconductor showing a sharp <rs type="tc">superconducting</rs> anomaly in <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x26">specific heat</rs> (C) in contrast to an unpronounced one in <rs type="material" xml:id="x27">polycrystalline BaPb 1-x Bi x O 3</rs> with a comparable <rs type="tc">T c</rs> <rs corresp="#x26,#x27" type="tcValue">~1 2 K</rs>. The upper critical field H c2 (0) of <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> reported by several groups varied from 2 to 32.8 T. Issues like whether the <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> in <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> can be well explained in the framework of BCS theory based upon the electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions and the role of the electron-electron (e-e) interactions have not been totally clearified. Some theoretical predictions showed that <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> was a strong coupling BCS superconductor while the low temperature <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> and <rs type="me_method">magnetic susceptibility</rs> data implied for the conditions for weak coupling d-band superconductivity. Furthermore, there has been a very recently revived debate on Anderson's resonating valance bond (RVB)-type ground state as the possible origin of <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> in <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>. Since the Ti sub-lattice of the spinel structure allows a high degree of frustration, RVB ground state is probable in the <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> spinel. In fact, the <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> (C), a thermodynamic bulk property unlike <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> and <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs>, of <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> has been elaborately studied by some groups in the absence of magnetic field (H). Though some of the derived parameters (listed in Table) agree quite well with each other, some of them differ significantly and lead to incompatible descriptions for the nature of <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs>. These controversies especially warrant a comprehensive revisit of <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> in <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> . In addition, the recent intensive investigations of its isostructural compounds <rs type="material">LiMn 2 O 4</rs> (Ref. ) and <rs type="material">LiV 2 O 4</rs> (Refs. 4 and 16) exhibiting respectively high-voltage electrolyte and 3d heavy fermion behavior also tempt us to study the crucial role of 3d metals in the spinel <rs type="class">oxide</rs> structure. In particular, it is interesting to study the evolution from 3d <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> to 3d heavy fermion in <rs type="material">Li(Ti 1-x V x ) 2 O 4</rs> . In this report, we thus provide the detailed magnetic field (up to 8 T) dependence of the low temperature <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> on <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs>, which has never been reported in the literature earlier and is crucial to the determination of <rs type="tc">superconducting</rs> properties, to explore its pairing mechanism of <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs>.</p>
      <p>The preparation and characterization of polycrystalline <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> used in this low temperature <rs type="me_method">specific heat measurement</rs> were described elsewhere. Highly pure Li 2 CO 3 and TiO 2 were mixed in an appropriate ratio, calcined in a quartz tube under pure oxygen atmosphere for 20 h at 750 0 C leading to the formation of Li 2 Ti 2 O 5 . Then it was mixed with a proper amount of Ti 2 O 3 , grounded thoroughly, pressed into pellets, and sintered at 880 0 C for 24 h under a dynamic vacuum with pressure less than 10 -4 torr. Basically, to obtain a <rs type="material">pure LiTi 2 O 4</rs> phase, one needs to add ~15% more of Li than nominal composition due to its volatility. Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) data obtained by SIEMENS D5000 diffractometer using CuKα radiation showed that <rs type="material">Li 1+x Ti 2 O 4</rs> exhibited <rs type="material">Ti 2 O 3</rs> impurity phase for <rs type="material">x=0</rs> and <rs type="material">pure LiTi 2 O 4</rs> phase was obtained for <rs type="material">0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.15</rs> (Ref. ) which was used for this <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> measurement. The <rs type="me_method">low temperature specific heat</rs> C(T,H) was measured with a 3 He heat-pulsed thermal relaxation calorimeter in the temperature range from 0.6 to 20 K under different C(T,H)/T vs. T 2 of <rs type="material" xml:id="x56">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> without and with a magnetic field of 8 T. The solid line is the best fit of C n (T)/T = ã n + âT 2 +αT 4 to the H = 8 T data between 8 and 20 K. magnetic fields (0 -8 T). The precision of the measurement in this temperature range is about 1%. To test the accuracy of the field dependence of <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x57">specific heat</rs>, C(T,H) of a standard copper sample was measured at H = 0, 1, and 8 T, respectively. The scatter of data in different magnetic fields was within 3%. <rs type="tc">T c</rs> (<rs corresp="#x56,#x57" type="tcValue">~11.4 K</rs>) obtained from <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> data is consistent with that measured by <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> on the same sample.</p>
        <p>Figure shows the <rs type="me_method">low temperature specific heat</rs> C(T,H) of <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> with H = 0 and 8 T as C/T vs. T 2 . The <rs type="me_method">normal state specific heat</rs> in the absence of magnetic field, is extracted from H = 8 T data between 8 and 20 K, where γ n T is the electronic term due to free charge carriers and C lattice (T) = βT 3 + αT 5 is representing the phonon contribution which is assumed to be independent of magnetic field. It is found that γ n = 19.15 ± 0.20 (mJ/mol K 2 ), β = 0.048 ± 0.002 (mJ/mol K 4 ), and α = 0.00012 ± 0.00005 (mJ/mol K 6 ) give the best fitting (solid line in Fig. ) to the experimental data. It is noted that if we take C lattice (T) = βT 3 + αT 5 + DT , the best fit occurs at negative value of D ( = -2.8±0.5 x 10 -7 mJ/mol K 8 ) which is unreasonable. On the other hand, C lattice (T)= βT 3 gives much higher RMS value compared to C lattice (T) = βT 3 + αT . The enhancement of γ n by the electron-phonon interaction is given by 19 where N(E F ) is the band structure density of states at the Fermi level, k B is the Boltzman constant, and λ is the electron-phonon interaction constant. Taking λ = 0.65 as obtained from <rs type="me_method">low temperature specific heat data</rs> (discussed later), the calculated value of N(E F ) for the present sample is ~ 0.70 states/eV atom. This is lower than that (~ 0.97 states/eV atom) perceived by McCallum et al. from <rs type="me_method">susceptibility</rs> data which would not satisfy the transition temperature from McMillan equation. However, the authors 2 indicated that the reduction of N(E F ) by 15% (orbital contribution and/or exchange enhancement to total <rs type="me_method">susceptibility</rs>) would explain it. The reduced N(E F ) is in close agreement with the present investigation. The Debye temperature Θ D = 657 ±33 K is derived by using the relation where n is the number of atoms per formula unit and takes 7 for <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> . This is somewhat higher than those experimentally obtained and theoretically predicted values (~575 K) but closer to those (685-700 K) reported by the group of D. C. Johnston. The values of γ n , N(E F ), and Θ D are listed in Table along with some other parameters for comparison with reported results. The characteristics of <rs type="tc">superconducting</rs> phase transition in <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> can be analyzed using the relation The resultant äC(T)/T vs. T is shown in Fig. , where the inset illustrates the conservation of entropy S = ∫ c T dT T C 0 δ around the transition. This conservation of entropy is essential for a second order, such as superconducting-normal, phase transition. In this case, fail to include αT 5 term in Eq. will not totally satisfy this requirement. In fact, this requirement may be used to testify the justification of the values of γ n and Θ D . The dimensionless specific-heat jump at <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is äC/γ n T c = 1.78 as indicated in Fig. which is greater than the typical weak coupling value (~1.43). Thus äC(T)/T is well fitted to the BCS model as shown in Fig. by the solid line with a little higher 2∆/k B T c (~ 4.0), where ∆ is the superconducting energy gap instead of the weak coupling value (~ 3.52). This value of 2∆/k B T c ~ 4 (i.e. ∆ = 1.97 meV) is consistent with 3.8 in the Ref. 3] and the reference therein where the tunneling experiments yielded the value of 4.0. Consequently, the <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> in <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> can be explained by the moderate coupling BCS framework though the early low temperature <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> and theoretical calculations respectively indicated weak and strong coupling.</p>

        <p>The electronic <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> in the <rs type="tc">superconducting</rs> state is given by C es (T) = C(T)-C lattice (T). Plot of logarithmic C es (T)/ã n T c vs. T c /T (Fig. ) shows that the fitting of data (as demonstrated by the solid line) within T c /T = 2 to 5 and follows the relation C es (T)/ã n T c = A exp [(-a T c /T)] with A = 9.87 and a = 1.58. However, the BCS theory predicts C es (T)/ã n T c = 8.5 exp [(-1.44 T c /T)] for this temperature fitting range in the weak coupling limit. Therefore, both the values of coefficient and prefactor are in the range of typical moderate coupling BCS fully gapped superconductors. The electron-phonon coupling constant λ is estimated to be ~ 0.65 (Table ) using the relation .</p>
        <p>According to McMillan model, for weak coupling λ « 1, for weak and intermediate coupling λ &lt; 1, and for strong coupling λ &gt; 1. Therefore, the present λ value suggests that <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> is a moderate coupling superconductor rather than a weak coupling one. Nevertheless, the value of λ is much lower than that (~1.8) of the theoretical predictions (indicating strong coupling superconductivity in <rs type="material" xml:id="x73">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> ) which may be due to the spin fluctuation effect. Taking Θ D = 657 K, ë = 0.65, and observed <rs type="tc">T c</rs> <rs corresp="#x73" type="tcValue">11.4 K</rs>, the Coulomb repulsion parameter ì* ~ 0.13 can be obtained from the McMillan formula, The value of ì* is the same as transition metals, and is in the range of those reported earlier 2-3 confirming the BCS-type d-band superconductivity in <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs>.</p>

It is noticed that the conservation of entropy (the area above and below zero of C/T are equivalent around the <rs type="tc">superconducting transition</rs>) is fundamentally satisfied for all studied magnetic fields.</p>

        <p>This implies that the sample is of good quality without detectable impurities (particularly magnetic field dependent non-superconducting phases). The dissimilar example has been observed in <rs type="material">Ba 1-x K x BiO 3</rs> (Ref. ) due to defects and the inhomogeneity of the sample. Figure demonstrates the magnetic field dependence of very low temperature (≤ 5 K) <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> as C/T vs. T 2 . The coefficient of electronic <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> γ(H) with various fields has been estimated from the linear extrapolation of data below 2 K down to 0 K. In order to investigate the low energy vortex excitation under magnetic fields, the variation of γ(H) with H is shown in Fig. . The best fit leads to γ(H) ~ H 0.95 as indicated by the solid line. Clearly, γ(H) follows an H dependence which is very close to be linear, especially for H ≥ 1 T. The slight deviation in low H could be due to the vortex-vortex interaction as discussed in Refs. 22 and 23. The value of H c2 (T = 0) estimated from Fig. using linear extrapolation of ã(H) for H ≥ 1 T to ã n ~19.15 mJ/mol K 2 is H c2 (T = 0) = 11.0 ± 0.5 T. It is noted that a pronounced nonlinearity of γ(H), seen in <rs type="material">UPt 3</rs> , <rs type="material">CeRu 2</rs> , and <rs type="material">NbSe 2</rs> , at low magnetic fields, is not obvious in the present <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> . Theoretically, γ(H) is expected to be proportional to H for a conventional s-wave superconductor. However, γ(H) ∝ H 0.5 is predicted for a nodal superconductivity. In fact, γ(H) of <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductors has been extensively studied in this context. Consequently, the magnetic field dependence of γ(H) suggests that <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> is an s-wave superconductor in nature.</p>

        <p>Figure shows the temperature variation of upper critical field H c2 (T) as obtained from where the solid line is the theoretical fitting based on negligible spin paramagnetic and spin-orbital effect by using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory. The error bar in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> (H) is determined by the sharpness of the <rs type="tc">superconducting transition</rs> as shown in the inset of Fig. for a particular magnetic field of 6 T. The same procedure is also followed for other magnetic fields. The best fit results in (dH c /dT c ) T= Tc = 1.45 ± 0.03 (T/K) and consequently H c2 (0) = 11.7 ± 0.4 T . It is noted that the value of H c2 (0) estimated from WHH theory is consistent with the value (11.0 ± 0.5 T) obtained from Fig. . This consistency implies that the spin-orbital interaction in <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> is negligible as considered for the fitting of the data with WHH theory. The small spin-orbital interaction is actually expected since Ti is one of the lightest transition elements. However, the H c2 (0) of present sample is much higher than that (~ 2 T) predicted by Heintz et al.</p>
          <p>but lower than that (~ 32.8 T) reported by Harrison et al. For type-II superconductors, the Pauli limiting field H p (0) = 1.84x10 4 T c should satisfy the relation H c2 (0) ≤ H p (0). Though Harrison et al. 7 concluded <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> to be an extreme type-II superconductor, their reported value of H c2 (0) did not satisfy the above condition. Our estimated value of H p (0) ~ 21 T (Table I) is higher than H c2 (0) ~ 11.7 T confirming the typical type-II <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> in <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> .</p>
        <ab type="figureCaption">Temperature variation of upper critical field H c2 (T) of <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> obtained from Fig. 4 where the solid line indicates the fitting of data with WHH theory by which H c2 (0) ~ 11.7 T is estimated. Inset shows the example how the error bar of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> (H) is determined by the sharpness of the <rs type="tc">superconducting transition</rs> for H = 6 T data. To determine the following important parameters of <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> , the residual resistivity ñ res~ 6.9 × 10 -5 Ù-cm was calculated from the formula 32 48× 10 4 ã n ñ res.</ab>
        <p>It is noted that the calculated ñ res , though much lower than the measured value (~ 5.3 × 10 -2 Ù -cm) from the <rs type="me_method">resistivity data</rs> (not shown), is in the same order of magnitude as that reported in Ref. . However, the measured value is consistent with that reported by Johnston et al. This large discrepancy between the measured and calculated ñ res indicates that the studied sample exhibits a lot of grain boundaries which highly affect its electrical transport properties. The <rs type="material">single crystalline LiTi 2 O 4</rs> may be indispensable for solving the puzzles of the transport properties. Thermodynamic critical field H c (0) ~ 0.320 ± 0.003 T, Ginzburg-London (GL) coherence length ξ GL (0) ~ 55 ± 3 Å , penetration depth λ GL (0)~ 1600 ± 50 Å , and lower critical field H c1 (0) ~ 26.0 ± 0.3 mT are estimated from the following relations in the dirty limit by using ã n ~ 4570 erg/cm 3 K 2 (converted from ã n 1 9.15 mJ/mol K 2 ), ñ res~ 6.9× 10 -5 Ù-cm (calculated from Eq. 7) and H c2 (0) ~ 11.7 T, H c (0where the fluxon Φ 0 2.0678 × 10 9 Oe Å 2 and κ [= The values of ξ GL (0) and λ GL (0) are, respectively, higher and lower than those (ξ GL (0) ~ 25.9 Å and λ GL (0) ~ 2730 Å ) reported by Harrison et al. Furthermore, H c1 (0) is in the range of the values achieved from 3 the M -H curve (~ 20 mT) and the fitting of H c1 (T) = H c1 (0)(T c -T) plot ( ~ 25 mT). All the obtained parameters ξ GL (0), λ GL (0), and κ of <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> further satisfy the conditions for type-II superconductivity. All the above estimation of the parameters assumes the dirty limit superconductivity in <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> . Consequently, it is of interest to estimate the value of mean free path l below <rs type="tc">T c</rs>, which should be smaller than that of ξ GL (0) in</p>
        <ab type="tableCaption">TABLE I. Some important parameters of <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> obtained from the present and earlier investigations.</ab>
        <p>the dirty limit. The band structure calculations indicate that the Fermi level of <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> in the partially filled conduction band lies in an electronic structure which is not too far from the free-electron-like one with a mass renormalization factor. By the free electron model with ñ res = 6.9× 10 -5 Ù-cm and the carrier concentration n = 1.35×110 23 cm -3 (Ref. ), the estimated l = 32 Å is indeed shorter than ξ GL (0). Therefore, the above analysis using Eq. in the dirty limit regime is self-consistent. In addition, the issue of the mass renormalization factor in the previous literature was actually unsolved. A large λ tot = 1.8 was inferred implying a strong electron-electron interaction with unknown origin. One can express λ tot = λ+λ e , where λ is the electron-phonon coupling constant and λ e manifests the interactions due to the possible spin fluctuations and other electron-electron interactions. If we rewrite Eq. (2) as γ n = (1/3)k B π 2 N(E F )(1+λ tot ) and assume the theoretical N(E F ) = 0.46 states/eV atom as achieved from the band structure calculations, then λ tot = 1.53 can be obtained from the γ n = 19.15 (mJ/mol K 2 ) of present <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> data. Therefore, the resultant λ e = λ tot -λ =1.53 -0.65=0.88 suggests a moderate electron-electron interaction in <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> , and is more consistent with a Stoner enhancement factor (1-S) -1~2 , which was derived from the <rs type="me_method">magnetic susceptibility</rs> χ = µ B 2 N(E F )/(1-S). Finally, it may be interesting to look over the existing <rs type="class">transition-metal oxide</rs> superconductors, such as, <rs type="material">BaPb 0.75 Bi 0.25 O 3</rs> (Ref. 12), <rs type="material">Ba 0.6 K 0.4 BiO 3</rs> (Refs. 21 and 34), <rs type="material">La 1.84 Sr 0.16 CuO 4</rs> (Refs. 35 and 36) and <rs type="material">Sr 2 RuO 4</rs> (Ref. 37) for comparison. Some of the important parameters along with those of our studied <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> are summarized in . One would find that the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of these superconductors does not strongly correlate with their structure, ã n , N(E F ), Θ D , and the electron-phonon coupling constant ë. It is also evident that the <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> of each material occurs at only very narrow transition-metal composition. A small amount of metal substitution or a little off-stoichiometry for transition metal will dramatically suppress the <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs>. Thus, the electronic properties of the transition metals Ti, Bi, Cu, and Ru must play an unique</p>
        <ab type="tableCaption">TABLE II. Comparison of several important parameters for particular <rs type="class">transition-metal oxide</rs> superconductors.</ab>
          <p>role on the occurrence of <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs>. In addition, the superconducting paring state of these superconductors varies from s-wave, d-wave to possible p-wave symmetry . Accordingly, theoretical calculations and experimental probes on the energy bands need to be done for clarifying these points. Moreover, three more <rs type="class">transition-metal oxide</rs> superconductors <rs type="material" xml:id="x121">Cd 2 Re 2 O 7</rs> (<rs type="tc">T c</rs> ~ <rs corresp="#x121" type="tcValue">1 K</rs>, Ref. ), <rs type="material" xml:id="x124">Na 0.35 CoO 2 ．1.3H 2 O</rs> (<rs type="tc">T c</rs> ~ <rs corresp="#x124" type="tcValue">5 K</rs>, Ref. ) and <rs type="material" xml:id="x127">KOs 2 O 6</rs> (<rs type="tc">T c</rs> ~ <rs corresp="#x127" type="tcValue">9 K</rs>, Ref. ) were reported most recently and also have attracted much attention due to their novel normal-and superconducting-state features. It is no doubt that the understanding of nature of <rs type="tc">superconductivity</rs> in <rs type="class">transition-metal oxide</rs> superconductors will still challenge the scientists in the fields of condensed matter physics.</p>
          <p>In summary, the low temperature <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> of <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> in magnetic fields is presented. Based on the present measurements and relevant theoretical relations, the normal-and superconducting-state parameters including electronic <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> coefficient ã n = 19.15 mJ/mol K 2 , Debye temperature Θ D = 657 K, äC/ã n <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ~ 1.78, superconducting energy gap ~ 1.97 meV, electron-phonon coupling constant ë ~ 0.65, upper critical field H c2 (0) ~ 11.7 T, thermodynamic critical field H c (0) ~ 0.32 T, coherence length î GL (0) ~ 55 Å , penetration depth ë GL (0) ~ 1600 Å , and lower critical field H c1 (0) ~ 26 mT are evaluated and compared with some of those reported.</p>
          <p>Combining the results C es (T)/ã n T c = 9.87exp(-1.58T c /T) and γ(H) ∝ H 0.95 , we conclude that <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> is a typical BCS-like, fully gapped, and moderate-coupling type-II superconductor in the dirty limit. The analysis also suggests that <rs type="material">LiTi 2 O 4</rs> is a moderately electron-electron correlated system.</p>
