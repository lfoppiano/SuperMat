        <p>Superconductivity in <rs type="class">transition metal oxides (TMOs)</rs> has been one of exciting fields in solid state physics due to its unconventional properties. Many superconductors in <rs type="class">TMOs</rs> crystallize in perovskite related structures. Recently, an exceptional <rs type="class">TMO</rs> superconductor <rs type="material" xml:id="x5">Cd 2 Re 2 O 7</rs> was found with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x5" type="tcValue">1.0 K</rs>, which crystallizes in the pyrochlore structure. 1) The pyrochlore structure contains a corner-sharing tetrahedral network made of transition metal cations called the pyrochlore lattice, and is known as one of spin frustration systems in the case that the transition metal cation has a localized moment with antiferromagnetic interactions between nearest neighbors. Very recently, three related compounds <rs type="material" xml:id="x8">AOs 2 O 6 (A = K, Rb, Cs)</rs> named the <rs type="class">β-pyrochlore oxides</rs> were found, 2-4) which contain the pyrochlore lattice made of Os atoms. They show superconductivity at <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x8" type="tcValue">9.6 K</rs>, <rs corresp="#x8" type="tcValue">6.3 K</rs> and <rs corresp="#x8" type="tcValue">3.3 K</rs>, respectively. Particularly in <rs type="material">KOs 2 O 6</rs> the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is almost one order higher than in <rs type="material">Cd 2 Re 2 O 7</rs> . The mechanism of the superconductivity has been extensively studied and was suggested to be unconventional. For example, a remarkably large upper critical field H c2 of 38 T exceeding Pauli's limit was reported for <rs type="material">KOs 2 O 6</rs> . 5) Moreover, the µSR and NMR experiments suggested an anisotropic order parameter. On the other hand, there are a few reports which suggest conventional BCS superconductivity for <rs type="material">RbOs 2 O 6</rs> . It is plausible to assume that the systematic change of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in <rs type="material">AOs 2 O 6</rs> is due to the size effect of alkaline metal ions. The lattice constant is almost proportional to the ionic radius of A ions, and the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> increases with decreasing the lattice constant from Cs to K under a positive chemical pressure. 4) This is in contrast to the case of conventional BCS superconductivity in a single-band model, where the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> decreases under a positive pressure, because the density of state (DOS) decreases with decreasing the lattice volume, as typically observed in <rs type="material">alkali metal doped C 60</rs> superconductors <rs type="material">A 3 C 60</rs> . This contrast may indicate the uniqueness of the superconductivity in <rs type="material">AOs 2 O 6</rs> . Thus, it is interesting to examine physical pressure effects on <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . In this note, we report <rs xml:id="x99990" type="me_method">diamagnetic measurements</rs> under pressures up to <rs type="pressure">1.2 GPa</rs> using a piston-cylinder type pressure cell on the three compounds of <rs type="material">AOs 2 O 6</rs> . In the <rs type="class">α-pyrochlore oxide</rs> superconductor <rs type="material" xml:id="x31">Cd 2 Re 2 O 7</rs> the high pressure study revealed that <rs type="tc">T c increases</rs> from <rs corresp="#x31,#x99990" type="tcValue" xml:id="x33">1.0 K</rs> to <rs corresp="#x31,#x99990" type="tcValue" xml:id="x34">3.0 K</rs> at <rs corresp="#x34" type="pressure">2 GPa</rs> and then decreases to vanish above <rs type="pressure">3 GPa</rs>. In the case of <rs type="material">RbOs 2 O 6</rs> , Khasanov et al. reported a high pressure experiment in which the <rs type="tc">T c increases</rs> monotonously up to 1.0 GPa with the initial slope of 0.90 K/GPa. Polycrystalline samples were prepared as reported previously. 2-4) They were nearly single-phase, but with a small amount of OsO 2 or Os metal. <rs type="me_method">Magnetic susceptibility</rs> was measured in a Quantum Design MPMS. Quasi-hydrostatic pressures up to 1.2 GPa were produced by a piston-cylinder type pressure cell which is made of hardened CuBe alloy. Daphne oil 7373 was used as a pressure transmitting medium. The actual pressure was determined in each experiment by measuring the <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs> of <rs type="material">Pb</rs> or <rs type="material">Sn</rs> which was put into the pressure medium together with a sample and placed about 2 cm away from the sample.</p>
    <p>A typical temperature dependence of <rs type="me_method">magnetic susceptibility</rs> for <rs type="material">KOs 2 O 6</rs> is shown in .</p>
    <p>In a field of 10 Oe after zero-field cooling, a large <rs type="tc">diamagnetic signal due to the shielding effect</rs> was observed at <rs type="tcValue">4 K</rs> in the whole pressure range. On heating, it disappears rapidly above 9 K. We defined <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in two ways. One is the <rs type="tc">onset temperature</rs> where the <rs xml:id="x99991" type="me_method">magnetic susceptibility</rs> starts to deviate from a background signal at high temperature. This temperature corresponds to the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> determined by <rs type="me_method">specific heat measurements</rs> or <rs type="me_method">resistivity measurements</rs> on bulk samples at <rs type="pressure">ambient pressure</rs> in a zero magnetic field. The other <rs type="tc">characteristic temperature T c</rs>' is determined to be the temperature where the diamagnetic signal becomes 5% of the maximum shielding signal.</p>
    <p>The pressure dependence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> as well as <rs type="tc">T c</rs> ' is plotted in . In <rs type="material">RbOs 2 O 6</rs> and <rs type="material">CsOs 2 O 6</rs> , the <rs type="tc">T c increases</rs> almost linearly with increasing pressure in the whole pressure range examined. The slope for <rs type="material">RbOs 2 O 6</rs> is 0.78 K/GPa, which is slightly smaller than the value reported by In remarkable contrast, the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs type="material" xml:id="x60">KOs 2 O 6</rs> exhibits a downturn with a maximum value of <rs corresp="#x60,#x99991" type="tcValue" xml:id="x61">10.0 K</rs> at <rs corresp="#x61" type="pressure">0.56 GPa</rs>, and then decreases to <rs corresp="#x60,#x99991" type="tcValue" xml:id="x63">9.5 K</rs> at <rs corresp="#x63" type="pressure">1.20 GPa</rs>. In order to compare the three systems, the pressure dependence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> (P) normalized by the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> at ambient pressure (AP) is shown in . The initial slope of {T c (P)/T c (AP)}/P is 0.20, 0.14 and 0.13 GPa -1 for A = Cs, Rb and K, respectively; the largest for <rs type="material">CsOs 2 O 6</rs> with the largest unit cell volume and the <rs type="tc">lowest T c</rs> at AP. The initial <rs type="tc">increase of T c</rs> by applying physical pressure commonly observed for the three compounds is consistent with the trend by chemical pressure. This means that the lattice volume is the key parameter to determine the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs type="material">AOs 2 O 6</rs> . The origin of the saturation and the following downturn in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> for <rs type="material">KOs 2 O 6</rs> is not clear at the moment but may indicate that a fluctuation relevant to the superconductivity is enhanced at certain pressure and suppressed of higher pressure. Further experiments at higher pressures are necessary to discuss this issure in more detail and are in progress.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, we measured the pressure dependence of <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> up to 1.2 GPa in order to deduce the pressure effect of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in the three <rs type="class">β-pyrochlore oxides.</rs> It is found that the initial pressure dependence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is positive for all the compounds. Only <rs type="material">KOs 2 O 6</rs> exhibits a saturation in <rs type="tc">T c</rs> at 0.56 GPa and the downturn at higher pressure.</p>
