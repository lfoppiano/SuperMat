          <p>We report the magnetotransport properties of <rs type="material">Bi2Sr2−xLaxCu1−zZnzO 6+δ (Zn-doped BSLCO) single crystals with z of up to 2.2%</rs>. Besides the typical Zn-doping effects on the <rs type="me_method">in-plane resistivity</rs> and the Hall angle, we demonstrate that the nature of the low-temperature normal state in the <rs type="material">Zn-doped samples</rs> is significantly altered from that in the pristine samples under high magnetic fields. In particular, we observe nearly-isotropic negative magnetoresistance as well as an increase in the Hall coefficient at very low temperatures in <rs type="material">non-superconducting Zn-doped samples</rs>, which we propose to be caused by the Kondo scattering from the local moments induced by Zn impurities.</p>

    <p>Effects of nonmagnetic Zn impurities on the elec- tronic properties of the high-T c <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> have been in- tensively studied, employing almost all available exper- imental tools. However, well-controlled studies of the Zn-doping effects using high-quality single crystals have been mostly limited to the <rs type="material">YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (YBCO)</rs> sys- tem and the <rs type="material">La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO)</rs> system because of the availability of single crystals; for example, in the otherwise well-studied system of <rs type="material">Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ (Bi-2212)</rs>, high-quality single crystals can be grown with only up to ∼1% of Zn substitution, posing difficulties for sys- tematic studies. Recently, high-quality <rs type="material">single crystals of Bi 2 Sr 2−x La x CuO 6+δ (BSLCO)</rs> have become available 1 in a wide range of hole concentrations. It is thus nat- ural to investigate the Zn-doping effect in the <rs type="material">BSLCO</rs> system to examine and expand our knowledge of the role of Zn impurities in the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>. Here we report that <rs type="material">Zn- doping of up to 2.2%</rs> is possible in high-quality <rs type="material">BSLCO crystals</rs> and present the effect of Zn impurities on the charge transport properties of this system.</p>
    <p>One of the most peculiar charge transport properties of the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> is that two distinct scattering rates, τ −1 tr and τ −1 H , possibly govern the <rs type="me_method">in-plane resistivity</rs> ρ ab and the Hall angle θ H , respectively. Zn impurities have been believed to induce 3,4 residual terms in both τ −1 tr and τ −1 H , which ultimately lead to charge localization 5 ; these resid- ual scattering rates may well be related 6 to the local moments induced by the nonmagnetic Zn impurities, 7 though the role of the local moments in the charge trans- port in <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> is not well understood yet. It would thus be meaningful to look for some peculiar features that is clearly due to the local moments in the transport prop- erties of the <rs type="material">Zn-doped BSLCO crystals</rs>.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the best-known effect of Zn-doping in <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> is the <rs type="tc">rapid suppression of T c</rs> . The <rs type="tc">rate of T c suppres- sion</rs> has been known to be around 10-15 K/at.% upon Zn substitution. It has been suggested 8,9 that this rate can be enhanced to ∼20 K/at.% near the hole concen- tration per Cu, p, of 1/8, which was discussed to be due to the "pinning" 10 of the charge stripes 11 by Zn impuri-ties. Since it was recently revealed 12 that the metal-to- insulator (M-I) crossover in the low-temperature normal state of <rs type="material">BSLCO</rs> occurs at p ≃ 1/8, it is particularly in- triguing to look at the effect of Zn at p ≃ 1/8 to elucidate the impact of the charge-stripes instability in <rs type="material">BSLCO</rs>.</p>
    <p>In this paper, we report the charge transport proper- ties in <rs type="material">Zn-doped BSLCO (Bi 2 Sr 2−x La x Cu 1−z Zn z O 6+δ ) single crystals with z of up to 2.2% for x = 0.50 and 0.66</rs>. These La contents correspond to p of ∼0.15 and ∼1/8, respectively, 2 and 2.2%-Zn is enough to completely <rs type="tc">sup- press superconductivity</rs> at <rs type="material">x = 0.66</rs>. We observe more or less standard Zn-doping effects in the <rs type="me_method">in-plane resis- tivity</rs>, Hall angle, and <rs type="tc">T c</rs>, without any noticeable "1/8 anomaly" in the <rs type="material">Zn-doped</rs> samples. On the other hand, we found very peculiar negative magnetoresistance as well as an upturn in R H at low temperatures in non- superconducting samples, which is most likely to be re- lated to the local moments induced by Zn.</p>
    <p>The crystals are grown by a floating-zone technique as reported previously. We have demonstrated 1,2,12 that our crystals are among the best available <rs type="material" xml:id="x22">BSLCO crys- tals</rs> in terms of optimum <rs type="tc">T c</rs> (which is <rs corresp="#x22" type="tcValue">as high as 38 K</rs>), residual resistivity, and the control of hole doping. The La concentrations in the crystals are determined by the electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA), and the actual Zn concentrations are measured by the inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) analysis; the errors in x and z are esti- mated to be ±0.01 and ±0.002, respectively. For the transport measurements, the crystals are cut into dimen- sions typically 1 × 0.5 × 0.02 mm 3 . The thickness of the samples are calculated from their weight (measured with 0.1-µg resolution) to accurately determine the absolute values of ρ ab and the Hall coefficient R H . All the crys- tals are annealed in air at 650 • C for 48 h and quenched to room temperature to achieve uniform oxygen distri- bution. A standard ac six-probe method is employed to measure ρ ab and R H . The magnetoresistance and R H are measured by sweeping the magnetic field to both plus and minus polarities at constant temperatures.</p>
    <p>For the non-superconducting samples with (x,z) = (0.66,0.022), . 1. ρ ab (T ) data of <rs type="material">Bi2Sr2−xLaxCu1−zZnzO 6+δ single crystals</rs> at (a) <rs type="material">x = 0.50</rs> and (b) <rs type="material">x = 0.66</rs> with various z. Inset to (a): Plots of (ρ ab − ρ0)/aT vs. T for <rs type="material">x = 0.50</rs> with the four z values; arrow marks T * . Inset to (b): Plots of Tc vs. z for <rs type="material">x = 0.50 and 0.66</rs>. we measure both the transverse and longitudinal magne- toresistance (MR) down to 450 mK in a 3 He refrigerator where the temperature control during the magnetic-field sweep is done with a stability of ∼1 mK using a capaci- tance sensor embedded in the sample stage. show temperature dependences of ρ ab for <rs type="material">x = 0.50 and 0.66</rs> with various Zn concentra- tions. One can see that at both x the ρ ab (T ) curves are almost parallel-shifted upon Zn doping, indicating that the main effect of Zn impurities on ρ ab is to increase a temperature-independent residual term in τ −1 tr . In the <rs type="material">x = 0.50</rs> series [], there is a reasonably wide region of T -linear resistivity at high temperatures, so that we can estimate the pseudogap temperature T * for each Zn concentration from the downward deviation of the ρ ab (T ) curves from the T -linear behavior. The inset of shows the plots of [ρ ab (T ) − ρ 0 ]/aT vs. T (where a is the T -linear slope and ρ 0 is the zero-temperature intercept of the T -linear behavior), which make it clear that the devi- ation takes place at nearly the same temperature (∼300 K) for all z. Thus, as was reported for <rs type="material">YBCO</rs>, T * as determined from ρ ab (T ) does not move with Zn doping in <rs type="material">BSLCO</rs>.</p>
    <p>In the <rs type="material">x = 0.66</rs> series [], it is notable that the superconductor-to-insulator (S-I) transition occurs around ρ ab of ∼400 µΩcm, which corresponds to the sheet resistance per CuO 2 plane of ∼3.3 kΩ; this is half the quantum value h/(2e) 2 (≃6.5 kΩ) and thus differs by a factor of 2 from the result of the critical sheet resistance obtained 4,13 for <rs type="material">YBCO</rs> and <rs type="material">LSCO</rs>, indicating that the "universal" critical sheet resistance for the S-I transition is not exactly universal for the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>. We emphasize that the uncertainty in the absolute value of ρ ab is less than 10% in our measurements. The inset of shows the <rs type="tc">suppression of T c</rs> upon Zn doping for the two x values; the suppression rates are almost the same for the two cases and is about 13 K/at.%, which is typical for the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>. Note that there is no enhancement in the T c -suppression rate for p ≃ 1/8 (<rs type="material">x = 0.66</rs>), and thus the sort of amplification of the 1/8 anomaly suggested for <rs type="material">LSCO</rs> and <rs type="material">Bi-2212</rs> are not observed in <rs type="material">BSLCO</rs>. This can be interpreted to mean that the charge-order instability at p ≃ 1/8 is so weak 14 in <rs type="material">BSLCO</rs> that the "pinning" by the Zn impuri- ties are not effective, though this interpretation is highly speculative.</p>
    <p>Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the temperature depen- dences of R H for the two series. For each x, the magni- tude of R H does not change with z above 200 K, demon- strating that the Zn substitution does not change the hole concentration. At lower temperatures, R H becomes z de- pendent and the peak in R H (T ) shows a non-monotonic change upon Zn doping. As is the case with other sys- tems, the complicated change in R H (T ) can be simplified by looking at the Hall angle. Figures 2(c) and 2(d) show the plots of cot θ H vs. T 2 for the two series. All the data of cot θ H are almost linear in T 2 and appear to be parallel-shifted upon Zn doping, suggesting that the Zn impurities increase a temperature-independent residual term in τ −1 H ; this is actually the behavior that led to the two-scattering-rate scenario 3 and thus is typical for the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>. Upon closer look at the data in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d), one may notice that at low temperatures there is an upward deviation from the T 2 behavior in the Zn-doped samples. To make this point clear, Figs. 2(e) and 2(f) show the plots of (cot θ H − c)/bT 2 vs. T , where b is the T 2 slope and c is the zero-temperature intercept of the linear-in-T 2 behavior. One can see that the deviation be- comes systematically more pronounced as z is increased; this behavior most likely reflects some localization effect in the Hall channel and is probably responsible for the weakening of the temperature dependence of R H upon</p>

(e),(f): Plots of (cot θH − c)/bT 2 vs. T for the two series, which emphasize the deviation from the T 2 behavior.</p>
    <p>As already noted, the superconductivity is completely suppressed in the <rs type="material">2.2%-Zn-doped samples at x = 0.66</rs>, in which we can measure the normal-state <rs type="me_method">transport</rs> prop- erties down to very low temperatures. Incidentally, the low-temperature normal-state transport has already been measured for <rs type="material">pristine BSLCO crystals with x = 0.66</rs> un- der 60-T magnetic field, 12 so we can directly compare the normal state brought about by Zn-doping to that brought about by high magnetic fields. As is shown in , 15 ρ ab (T ) increases with decreasing tempera- ture below ∼30 K and the temperature dependence is quicker than log(1/T ), which is inferred from a positive curvature in this semi-log plot; this behavior is contrast- ing to the "metallic" behavior found 12 in the <rs type="material">pristine sample with x = 0.66</rs>, where ρ ab becomes temperature independent below ∼10 K with ρ ab ≃ 190 µΩcm. There- fore, the localization behavior in the <rs type="material">Zn-doped sample</rs> is clearly due to the additional scattering caused by the Zn impurities. Also, since the "insulating" behavior found 12 in more <rs type="material">underdoped pristine samples (p &lt; 1/8)</rs> is consis- tent with log(1/T ) (which is slower than the behavior of the <rs type="material">Zn-doped samples</rs>), the nature of the charge-localized</p>
    <p>(a) log T plot of ρ b of a <rs type="material">2.2%-Zn-doped x = 0.66</rs> sample; RH (T ) is also plotted using the right-hand-side axis. (b) Magnetoresistance of the above ρ b -sample (I b) at 450 mK for H along a, b, and c. state in the <rs type="material">Zn-doped sample</rs> is apparently different from that in the pristine sample under high magnetic field.</p>
    <p>It is found that R H of the <rs type="material">non-superconducting Zn- doped samples</rs> also shows an upturn at low temperatures []; this is again in contrast to the R H (T ) be- havior of the <rs type="material">pristine samples</rs> 16 under 60 T, which be- comes essentially temperature independent at low tem- peratures. The rather strong temperature dependence of R H below ∼3 K in the <rs type="material">Zn-doped samples</rs> strongly sug- gests that the Zn-induced charge localization is not due to a simple weak localization effect. We can obtain further insight into the Zn-induced lo- calized state from the magnetoresistance (MR), which turns out to be negative at low temperatures and is very peculiar. shows the MR at 450 mK for three geometries; the sample was cut so that the current I flows along the b-axis, and the magnetic field H is applied along a, b (longitudinal geometry), and c (transverse geome- try). There is essentially no anisotropy between H a and H b. The anisotropy between H b and H c is less than a factor of 2 and the H dependences for the two geometries are almost exactly the same. Therefore, we can conclude that the MR is essentially isotropic and thus is of spin origin. The H dependence of this negative MR is not H 2 but is reminiscent of the H dependence expected for Kondo scattering. Since the Kondo ef- fect should yield isotropic MR, the main features of the</p>
    <p>Magnetoresistance of a <rs type="material">2.2%-Zn-doped x = 0.66</rs> sample for (a) H c (transverse) and (b) H b (longitudinal) at low temperatures (I b). MR observed here appears to be consistent, at least qual- itatively, with what is expected for the Kondo effect. It is useful to note that a very anisotropic negative MR coming from weak localization has been observed 20 in <rs type="material">non-superconducting samples of pristine Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO 6+δ</rs>, which is contrasting to our observation in the <rs type="material">Zn-doped samples</rs>.</p>
    <p>The evolution of the MR with temperature is shown in for H c and H b. The MR becomes predomi- nantly negative below ∼5 K, which is nearly the same as the <rs type="tc">onset temperature</rs> of the low-temperature upturn in R H (T ), and therefore the negative MR and the increase in R H appear to have a common origin. It is useful to note that the Kondo scattering is expected to become ef- fective simultaneously in the MR and in the Hall effect. Thus, all the above results of the low-temperature MR and R H seem to be most consistent with the Kondo ef- fect, which may be caused by the local moments 7 induced by the Zn impurities. The possibility that the Kondo effect is playing a major role in the Zn-doped sam- ples also explains the various differences between the nor- mal state in the <rs type="material">Zn-doped samples</rs> and that in <rs type="material">pristine samples</rs> under high magnetic fields. For more quanti- tative understanding of the possible Kondo effect in the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs>, <rs type="me_method">theoretical calculations</rs> for the Kondo scatter- ing in the non-Fermi-liquid ground state of the <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> would be required.</p>
    <p>To summarize, in the <rs type="material">BSLCO crystals</rs> we observed quite typical Zn-doping effects on ρ ab (T ) and cot θ H (T ), and found no 1/8 anomaly in the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> suppression rate. Comparison of the low-temperature normal state brought about by Zn-doping to that brought about by high magnetic field reveals significant difference between the two, which highlights the peculiar nature of the charge- localized state in the <rs type="material">Zn-doped samples</rs>. The negative MR and the upturn in R H observed at low temperatures strongly suggest that the Kondo scattering due to the local moments induced by Zn is playing a key role.</p>
