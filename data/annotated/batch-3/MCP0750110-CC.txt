Tuning of the superconducting and ferromagnetic transitions by Cu doping for Ru in GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8
In order to explore the possibility of tuning superconducting and ferromagnetic transitions by Cu doping (for Ru) in GdSr2RuCu2O8, we have carried out synthesis and characterization of GdSr2Ru1−xCu2+xO8 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) and studied their physical properties. Coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is observed in all the Cu doped samples studied here. The zero field susceptibility data suggests formation of a spontaneous vortex phase. Cu doping decreases the ferromagnetic Curie temperature, whereas the superconducting transition temperature increases until an optimal concentration x ∼0.1. This reflects an increase in hole transfer to the CuO2 planes and reduction of ferromagnetic order within the ruthenate layers.

Superconductivity (SC) and ferromagnetism (FM) are generally believed to be two mutually antagonistic orders. However, many interesting consequences like coexistence of triplet SC with FM, formation of a spontaneous vor- tex phase 1 , spatially inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type superconducting order 2 , etc. can arise if such a coexistence occurs. Thus, the observation of SC (with a high superconducting transition temperature T c ∼ 46K) coexisting with FM (with the magnetic transition temperature T m ∼ 132K) in the hybrid rutheno-cuprate GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 3,4,5 has motivated intense activity to characterize the families of compounds 6 LnSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 and Ln 1+x Ce 1−x Sr 2 RuCu 2 O 10 (Ln = Sm, Eu, Gd), and to study the nature of superconductivity, magnetism and their inter-relation. GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 is isostructural with the well known YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ with Y and Ba being completely replaced by Gd and Sr respectively, and the CuO chain replaced by RuO 2 planes. While the current broad understanding of the system is that SC originates in the CuO 2 planes and FM in the RuO 2 planes, details of the nature of both SC and magnetism require further understanding. GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 has a very low H c1 (< ∼100 Oe) and the superconducting properties are highly dependent on the details of sample preparation. Rietveld refinement of the x-ray diffraction pattern of GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 showed 7 that oxygen annealing leads to variation of the cation compo- sition without change in the oxygen content. The formal charge of Cu, which is less than the optimal value (for the occurrence of SC) for the as-prepared sample, increases upon prolonged annealing . It thus appears that the pu- rity of the starting materials and the heating schedules play a crucial role in the structure and microstructure of the final product 8 , thereby rationalizing contradictory reports 9 of existence and non-existence of SC in this com- pound.
The neutron diffraction studies suggest that the magnetic order in GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 is predominantly G- type antiferromagntic alignment of the Ru moments with a low temperature moment ∼1 mB along c axis. How- ever, the magnetization studies show a spontaneous magnetization Ms ∼0.1mB (per Ru). These two results can be reconciled if the Ru moments are canted to give a net magnetic moment in a direction perpendicular to the c axis. Neutron diffraction study 14 of the related com- pound YSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 showed a spontaneous magnetic moment ∼0.28 mB (which could be enhanced by apply- ing an external magnetic field) perpendicular to the c axis. A recent analysis 15 of the magnetization data sug- gests I-type ordering consistent with a band structure calculation , but inconsistent with the neutron diffrac- tion studies. Further, the magnetism will also be affected by the valence of Ru. The formal valence of Ru has been taken to be 5+ in most of the previous Rietveld analyses. Recent NMR 17 and XANES 18 studies indicate mixed valence for Ru with 40% Ru 4+ and 60% Ru 5+ in GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8. This also entails several possibilities 18 for the magnetic order in this compound. Thus, the pre- cise nature of magnetic order in this compound still re- mains controversial and needs to be explored.
The effect of substitution on the physical properties of this system is also very interesting and has been reported in literature . Sn doping 19 suppresses T m from 138K for x = 0 to 78K for x = 0.4 in GdSr 2 Ru 1−x Sn x Cu 2 O 8 and T c increases from 36K at x = 0 to 48K at x = 0.2 but falls thereafter. On the other . 1: X-ray diffraction patterns of GdSr2Ru1−xCu2+xO8 for (a) x = 0, (b) x=0.05, (c) x=0.1 and (d) x=0.2. The lines corresponding to the impurity phases are shown with *. hand even a small fraction of Zn (for Cu) rapidly re- duces T c and superconductivity is completely suppressed for the 3% substituted sample 3,4 . Motivated by above considerations, we have undertaken a study of tuning of the superconducting and magnetic properties by Cu doping for Ru in GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 . In this regard, and in continuation of our previous work 20 , we have prepared GdSr 2 Ru 1−x Cu 2+x O 8 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) and investi- gated their properties, which are presented below.
The compounds have been synthesized by the high temperature solid state reaction technique, which is com- monly employed for the synthesis of high temperature superconductors. Stoichiometric quantities of Gd 2 O 3 , SrCO 3 , CuO and Ru powder, all > 99.99% pure, have been mixed and ground. The mixture (in the form of powder) is heated at 600 • C for 48 hours to avoid RuO 2 volatility and then at 950 • C, in air, for 24 hours. It is then compressed into pellets and then heated at 1000 • C in air for 72 hours. Repeated grinding and heating at 1000 • C in air is necessary to obtain phase pure samples. A final step involving annealing at 1060 • C in oxygen for 96 hours is necessary to obtain the desired superconduct- ing characteristics. High resolution X-ray powder diffrac- tion analysis is carried out using a STOE Powder diffrac- tometer in the step scanning mode. Electrical resistiv- ity (four probe method, 4.2-300K) and AC Susceptibility (4.2-300K) have been carried out using home-assembled equipments. D.C.

shows the XRD of GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 . Phase analysis by XRD indicates that the impurity phase con- tent is < 5%. The XRD pattern has been analyzed on the basis of the reported tetragonal structure with space group P4/mmm, and lattice constants have been found to be a=3.83Å and c=11.58Å which are in close agree- ment with the values reported in the literature . From the analysis of several other samples of GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 it is estimated that the detectability limit of the impu-rity phases like SrRuO 3 and GdSr 2 RuO 6 type phases and CuO by XRD is < 1%. The crystallite sizes of the sample are small ∼500-1000Å as calculated from XRD line widths using the Scherrer formula. shows the resistance (R) vs temperature (T) curve of GdSr 2 Ru 1−x Cu 2+x O 8 . This plot clearly indicates the occurrence of superconductivity in these samples, with T c onset of 26.5K and zero resistance at around 6.4K for the stoichiometric composition GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8. The broadness of the transition may be due to the small crys- tallite size. shows the ac susceptibility, χ, of GdSr 2 Ru 1−x Cu 2+x O 8 as a function of temperature.

Magnetic transition temperatute Tm is shown as a function of x in the inset. of ferromagnetism of the material. On closer examina- tion of the R vs T plot, the magnetic ordering transi- tion can be seen as a change in slope at ∼139.2K. The diamagnetic shift corresponding to the superconducting transition at 26.5K is not observed in the susceptibility data for the stoichiometric composition GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 () below 26.5K. On the other hand, the χ in- creases with decrease in T below 26.5K ). The steep increase in χ at low temperature arises due to the paramagnetic contribution of the Gd moments which or- der antiferromagneticaly at 2.5K. It is believed that the superconductivity is weak and is also perhaps not homo- geneous with the result that the magnetic signal due to the paramagnetic contribution of the Gd moments over- whelms the diamagnetic superconducting signal. In order to confirm ferromagnetism in GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 , isother- mal magnetization studies have been carried out as a function of field at T=5K. presents the M-H plot for GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 along with an inset indicating the low field part of the hysteresis loop .The shape of the M-H curve is characteristic of FM and shows weak hysteresis with a low coercive field of ∼200 Oe . The magnetization studies at high fields indi- cate a saturation magnetization of 7 mB corresponding to ordering of Gd moments in high field. b, c and d show the XRD patterns of com- pounds GdSr 2 Ru 1−x Cu 2+x O 8 (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2). The samples with x = 0.05, x=0.1 and x=0.2 have impurity phase content approximately < 2%, < 1% and < 3%, respectively. All these compositions have the tetragonal structure with space group P4/mmm, isostructural with the stoichiometric composition. The lattice parameters of the compounds GdSr 2 Ru 1−x Cu 2+x O 8 (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2,) are almost identical, a ∼ 3.83Å and c ∼ 11.57 A and do not differ significantly from the stoichiometric GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 . shows the temperature dependence of resis- tance for GdSr 2 Ru 1−x Cu 2+x O 8 (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) along with that of the x=0 sample. All of them exhibit super- conductivity with zero resistance. The onset and zero re- sistance temperatures are (26.5, 6.4), (39.5, 12.6), (47.2, 28.3) and (40.0, 16.8)K respectively for x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2. One of the most important observations is that by Cu doping T c can be increased and x=0.1 appears to FIG. 4: M vs H curve for (a) GdSr2RuCu2O8 at 5K and (b) GdSr2Ru0.9Cu2.1O8 at T=5K, 30K and 80K. Inset in each figure shows the low field part of the hysteresis loop at 5K. be the optimum Cu doping concentration. It is also to be noted that these compounds are metallic over most of the temperature range down to 100K. Below 100K there is a semiconducting-like upturn just above the transition to superconducting state. This may be due to the effect of granularity or magnetic scattering. Further experi- ments in a magnetic field would clarify this and are in progress. However it is interesting to note that the sam- ple x=0.1, which shows the highest T c , also has the min- imum semiconducting upturn. The ac susceptibility vs temperature plots for GdSr 2 Ru 1−x Cu 2+x O 8 (x=0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2) are shown in . It may be noted that the undoped composition did not show a diamag- netic signal corresponding to superconductivity, whereas all the Cu substituted compositions show signature of superconductivity in the ac susceptibility measurements as well. This may be due to an increase in grain size and/or homogeneity. The ferromagnetic transitions are also observed in the Cu doped samples ) but at a significantly lower temperature (the magnetic transi- tion temperature T m being 135.8K, 129.9K and 123.2K respectively for x = 0.05, 0.1 and x=0.2 ) as compared to 139.2K for the stoichiometric GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 . shows the isothermal magnetization hysteresis at 5, 30 and 80K for a typical Cu doped sample with composition GdSr 2 Ru 0.9 Cu 2.1 O 8 . This confirms the presence of weak ferromagnetism in the Cu doped samples similar to the stoichiometric GdSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8.
As GdSr 2 Ru 0.9 Cu 2.1 O 8 had the highest T c and also happens to have the highest purity (< 1% impurity phase content) more detailed measurements have been carried out on it. Zero Field Cooled (ZFC) and Field Cooled

(FC) measurements of ac susceptibility yielded identical results. shows the field cooled ac susceptibility in different measuring fields (amplitude = 0.25, 0.125 and 0.0625 Oe) for GdSr 2 Ru 0.9 Cu 2.1 O 8. The ac χ starts to decrease at T∼38K indicating the onset of superconduc- tivity. A significant change in slope of χ vs T is ob- served at T m ∼23K below the superconducting transi- tion. This is perhaps an evidence of the transition from a bulk Meissner state to a spontaneous vortex state sim- ilar to that observed by in dc χ mea- surements. A smaller amplitude of the measuring field results in a stronger diamagnetic signal (see ). The incomplete shielding effect is due to the low value of the lower critical field H c1 that has been reduced by impurity scattering or small grain size.
The dc magnetization studies on GdSr 2 Ru 0.9 Cu 2.1 O 8 as a function of temperature under different applied fields are presented in . The magnetization shows a ten- dency to decrease at T∼38K. This temperature corre- sponds to the onset (of superconducting transition) T c measured by ac χ. However at lower temperature mag-

netization starts increasing and goes through a maximum in the ZFC measurements and increases monotonically in the FC measurements. The increase may be due to the paramagnetic contribution of Gd moments. The mag- netization curves can be reconciled with as an additive effect due to the contributions to the signal of diamag- netism related to superconductivity and the paramag- netic response of the Gd 3+ ions.
In conclusion, GdSr 2 Ru 1−x Cu 2+x O 8 (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) exhibits superconducting and ferromagnetic transi- tions, which can be tuned by Cu doping for Ru. T c is increased by partial substitution of Ru by Cu. A doping level of 0.1 gives a maximum T c amongst the investigated compositions. Partial substitution of Ru by Cu also has the effect of decreasing the magnetic ordering tempera- ture, from 139.2K for the undoped composition to 123.2K
