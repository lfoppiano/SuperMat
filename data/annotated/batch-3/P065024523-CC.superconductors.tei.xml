          <p>Thermodynamic critical field curves have been measured for <rs type="material">La2−xSrxCuO 4+δ</rs> over the full range of carrier concentra- tions where <rs type="tc">superconductivity occurs</rs> in order to determine changes in the normal state density of states with carrier con- centration. There is a substantial window in the H − T plane where the measurements are possible because the samples are both thermodynamically reversible and the temperature is low enough that vortex fluctuations are not important. In this window, the data fit Hao-Clem rather well, so this model is used to determine Hc and κc for each temperature and car- rier concentration. Using N (0) and the ratio of the energy gap to transition temperature, ∆(0)/kBTc, as fitting param- eters, the Hc vs T curves give ∆(0)/kB Tc ∼ 2.0 over the whole range of x. Values of N (0) remain rather constant in the optimum-doped and overdoped regime, but drops quickly toward zero in the underdoped regime. .</p>

    <p>In the study of superconductivity in the <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> ma- terials, the density of states at the Fermi surface, N (0), is a key variable in the determination of the transition temperature. The <rs type="material">La 2−x Sr x CuO 4+δ</rs> system is a doped insulator for <rs type="material">x = 0</rs> and the carrier concentration can be increased in an orderly way by holding the oxygen concentration constant and increasing the Sr content. 1 Numerous <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> measurements 2,3 have been car- ried out to gain insight into the changes in the density of states. The determination of N (0) from <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> data, however, is made difficult because the lattice <rs type="me_method">spe- cific heat</rs> is large and because the upper critical field is above the reach of the magnets available. Another ap- proach to the changes in N (0) is through the study of optical conductivity. 4 By assuming a Drude like absorp- tion and integrating over all frequencies, it was found that N (0) rises in the underdoped region and levels off in the overdoped region.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this work is to measure the ther- modynamic critical field curves, H c vs. T , for the <rs type="material">La 2−x Sr x CuO 4+δ</rs> system over the entire range of super- conductivity. Thermodynamic critical field data are im- portant in their own right because they give the free en- ergy difference between the superconducting and normal state and a good starting place for theory. In addition, we wish to compare the thermodynamic critical fields of <rs type="material">La 2−x Sr x CuO 4+δ</rs> with those of classical supercon- ductors and with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) picture. Within the BCS model and succeeding strong coupling modifications, 6 the ratio of the critical field at T = 0 to the <rs type="tc">critical temperature</rs>, H o /k B T c is related to N (0) and the curvature of the H c vs. T curve is related to the ratio of the energy gap at T = 0 to transition temper- ature, ∆(0)/k B T c . The goal is to measure these changes in N (0) and ∆(0)/k B T c as the Sr content changes.</p>
    <p>There is a vocabulary problem in the discussion of these data in that the thermodynamic critical field curve and the free energy difference are most closely related to the condensation energy per Cooper pair rather than the energy gap. In BCS, the two quantities are equiva- lent, and we have used the terms interchangeably in the discussion here because we are comparing the results to BCS.</p>
    <p>A preliminary single crystal study recently published 7 illustrates the success and difficulties of measuring thermodynamic critical fields in this system. Exten- sive measurements 7 of a high quality <rs type="material">single crystal of La 1.90 Sr 0.10 CuO 4+δ</rs> have shown that the superconduct- ing <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> curves, M sc vs. H, of this moderately underdoped high temperature superconductor obeys the Hao-Clem model 8 over a wide range of temperature, T , and magnetic fields, H. The Hao-Clem model is a variational calculation developed originally for the <rs type="material">Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ</rs> system and it was shown to describe the <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> curves, well for both <rs type="material">Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ 9</rs> and <rs type="material">La 2−x Sr x CuO 4+δ</rs> system. In the <rs type="material">La 1.90 Sr 0.10 CuO 4+δ</rs> studies, it also was found that the normal state back- ground magnetization follows a 2D Heisenberg model 10 for the Cu spins with values close to those measured previously by Nakano and coworkers. In addition, this <rs type="material">x = 0.10</rs> sample showed a vortex fluctuation contribution to the <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> 12 close to <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . The presence of these fluctuations limits the temperature range of applicabil- ity of Hao-Clem because they introduce a new term in the free energy. We only use Hao-Clem in regions where these fluctuations do not contribute significantly. At low temperature irreversibility of the <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> prevents equilibrium <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> measurements and close to <rs type="tc">T c</rs>, fluctuations make Hao-Clem inapplicable. Even so, there is a window for each x-value where Hao-Clem works well and thermodynamic critical fields can be measured.</p>
    <p>Both single crystals and grain-aligned-powders are used in this work. In the early part of the experiment, it was thought that it would be easier to control the oxy- gen content in grain-aligned-powders than in single crys- tals because the diffusion distance for oxygen would be less. Single crystals from three different sources, however, have given essentially the same result as the powders. Magnetically aligned samples were prepared by grinding appropriate amounts of La 2 O 3 , SrCO 3 and CuO in an agate mortar and pestle. Mixed and ground powders were pressed into pellets, placed in an alumina boat, and initially fired for 24h at 750 • C. This was followed by grinding, pelletizing, and firing several times at 850 • C and 970 • C for 48 and 72h respectively. After several cy- cles at these temperatures, the grinding, pelletizing and sintering was done at successively higher temperatures of 1000 • C, 1050 • C, and 1100 • C in a tube with oxygen flowing at 2.5cm 3 /min for 24h each time. Measurements of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> and zero-field-cooled Meissner screening fraction at 1.0 mT were carried out as the first test for sample qual- ity. The final pellet was ground to a particle size of about 20 µm, mixed with a low viscosity epoxy (Epotek 301), oriented in a magnetic field of 8.0 T , and then the epoxy was allowed to harden. X-ray diffraction patterns showed only (00ℓ) peaks. The full width at half maximum of the (008) peak was 5 • . Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements were used to determine the Sr content or x-value.</p>
    <p><rs type="me_method">Magnetization</rs> data were taken with H c in a Quan- tum Designs magnetometer with a 3 − cm scan for the <rs type="material">x = 0.13 single crystal</rs> and a 6−cm scan for all others. In this magnetometer, the sample is moved through a series of three pick-up coils, and the length of scan determines the uniformity of magnetic field seen by the sample dur- ing the scan. We selected the sample that has the <rs type="tc">highest T c</rs> for any given x-value and this corresponded well with literature values in all cases. In the region of <rs type="material">x = 1/8</rs>, the superconducting transition widths are about double the width away from this region. In this work, the <rs type="me_method">mag- netization</rs> is taken to be thermodynamically reversible if the difference in the field increasing and field decreas- ing <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> is less than one percent of the average <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs>. The range of temperatures was 1.4 K to 300 K, and the range of magnetic fields was 0 to 7 T .</p>
      <p>The <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs>, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , for both the single crystals (solid triangles) and the grain aligned powders (solid circles) are rather close to the liter- ature values as shown in . There is a very clear dip in the curve near <rs type="material">x = 1/8</rs> similar to that found by others and in <rs type="material">La 2−x Ba x CuO 4+δ</rs> . The <rs type="tc">T c</rs> values for the grain aligned samples agree well with the single crystals pub- lished here as well as those reported in the literature. 14</p>
      <p>There is a very predictable and regular background <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs>, M b , that appears to arise primarily from the Cu spin system. Measurements of M b in the normal state were made between 60 K and 200 K and found to fit the relation, where the dominant term is the linear CH term. In Eq.1, C, M s , and β are fit constants. shows that the magnitude of this <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> is on the order of 10 −5 to 10 −3 µ B /Cu atom. As reported earlier for the <rs type="material">x = 0.10 single crystal</rs>, the M s tanh (βH) term saturates at about 0.1 T and the value of M s ranges between 3−6× 10 −5 µ B /Cu atom. The M s tanh (βH) term is small and both M s and β are nearly independent of temperature and x-value in the range measured. The value of the slope of the linear term, C, is rather close to the values reported by Nakano and coworkers 11 as shown by . The solid lines are from Ref. 5 for <rs type="material">x = 0.10, 0.14, 0.16, 0.20, 0.26</rs> running from bottom to top. To determine the normal state <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> at temperatures below <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , the value of C is linearly extrapolated from the 60 K to 200 K data to the desired temperature and M b is determined from Eq. 1. Because the constants, M s and β do not change with temperature, they are taken to be the average of the values determined from 60 − 200 K.</p>
      <p>In the over-doped region, the irreversibility field, H irr , has essentially the same values as the optimum doped sample as shown in the reduced temperature, T /T c plot of . In the underdoped region, the flux pinning is much weaker and H irr drops to lower values. As Janossy and coworkers 15 showed for <rs type="material">Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ</rs> , as charge carriers are removed from the <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductor, the material becomes more anisotropic and the pinning is reduced.</p>
      <p>To determine the <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> of the superconduct- ing charge carriers, M sc , the background <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> is subtracted from the total measured <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs>, M t , by, M sc = M t − M b . To illustrate the results, shows superconducting magnetization data as a function of magnetic field for the interval between H irr and the field where vortex fluctuations become important. In the first attempt to fit these data to the Hao-Clem model, both H c and κ c are used as adjustable parameters. Here, κ c = H c2 / √ 2H c is approximately the ratio of the pen- etration depth to the coherence distance. Usually the data do not extend very close to H c2 , so the fit is not very sensitive to κ c . Hence, the average of κ c for any given x-value is used and H c is adjusted slightly for the best fit. For the optimum-doped and overdoped range, κ c ranges from 80 to 120. The maximum value of κ c is about 200 for <rs type="material">x = 0.10</rs> and it falls to about 120 again in the <rs type="material">x equal to 0.07 − 0.08</rs> range. The fits to Hao-Clem and the resulting H c vs.T curve are shown in .</p>
      <p>The critical field curve data for samples in the over- doped regime are shown in , and the data for the underdoped regime are shown in . The solid lines through the data are best fit parabolas of the form In the overdoped data of , the ratio of H o /T c remains relatively constant, and in the underdoped regime, the ratio of H o /T c drops quickly as the x-value or charge carrier concentration is reduced.</p>
      <p>The BCS theory 5 has been very successful describing the thermodynamic critical field curves of classical super- conductors. Within the theory, the H c value at any given temperature can be calculated from two microscopic vari- ables, the ratio of the energy gap to the thermal energy, ∆(T )/k B T at that temperature and the value of the den- sity of states, N (0). Modifications of BCS to include strong-coupling effects show that the ratio of the energy gap at T = 0 to k B T c, ∆(0)/k B T c rises above the weak- coupling BCS value of ∆(0)/k B T c = 1.76 to values above ∆(0)/k B T c = 2 for strong-coupling superconductors like P b and Hg. For these materials, the temperature depen- dence of ∆(T )/∆(0) has approximately the same shape as the original BCS form.</p>
      <p>To compare and contrast these <rs type="material">La 2−x Sr x CuO 4+δ</rs> su- perconductors with classical superconductors, we assume that strong-coupling BCS theory applies to both classes of material and do a two parameter fit of the thermo- dynamic critical field curves using N (0) and ∆(0)/k B T c as fitting variables. In this fitting, N (0) controls the magnitude of H c and ∆(0)/k B T c controls the curvature of the H c vs.T plot. The results are shown in and 8b. The value of ∆(0)/k B T c is consistently in the 1.9 to 2.1 range with the underdoped samples being very similar to the overdoped samples. The <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> γ, which is related to N (0) by γ = 2/3π 2 k 2 B N (0), is rela- tively constant at 3.0 mJ/mol K 2 in the optimum and overdoped region. The value of γ then drops quickly to a minimum at the <rs type="material">x = 1/8</rs> region, rises to a maximum at <rs type="material">x = 0.010</rs>, and falls quickly as x falls in the underdoped regime. Measured values of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> are also shown in for comparison with the trajectory of γ vs. x. A much more detailed discussion of the data and the analysis is given elsewhere.</p>
      <p>There is a reasonable window of thermodynamic re- versibility where equilibrium magnetization curves can be measured in the <rs type="material">La 2−x Sr x CuO 4+δ</rs> system. The super- conducting <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> curves obey Hao-Clem rather well, even in the underdoped region as long as data are taken in the range of applicability of the model. As the x- value drops, H irr drops giving a wider region of the H −T plane. The range of vortex fluctuations, however, also in- creases so that the temperature interval where Hao-Clem can be used remains roughly constant over the x-values measured.</p>
      <p>Thermodynamic critical field curves for <rs type="material">La 2−x Sr x CuO 4+δ</rs> are rather similar to those of classi- cal superconductors. From the curvature of the H c vs.T plots, one can derive a ∆(0)/k B T c value that is roughly independent of x and equal to about 2.0. From the mag- nitude of the H c vs.T plot, the <rs type="me_method">specific heat</rs> γ remains nearly constant at 3.0 mJ/mol K 2 in the overdoped re- gion. In the underdoped region, γ falls to a minimum at the <rs type="material">x = 1/8</rs> value, rises to a maximum at <rs type="material">x = 0.10</rs>, and then falls quickly toward zero as x approaches 0.06. In the broad picture, N (0) is roughly constant in the over- doped regime, and N (0) falls quickly in the underdoped regime. In this broad feature, the data are similar to the change in the density of states found by integrating optical absorption data over all frequencies.</p>
