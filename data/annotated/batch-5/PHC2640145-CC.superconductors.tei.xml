          <p><rs type="material">HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8+δ superconductor (Hg-1223)</rs> still has the <rs type="tc">highest critical temperature</rs> in various superconductors, which is a layered perovskite with the space group of P4/mmm. A structural unit of cation-layers is stacked in a sequence of -HgO-BaO-CuO-Ca-along the c-axis. The substitution of <rs type="material">Hg</rs> by <rs type="material">Pb</rs> enhances the stability of the <rs type="material">Hg-1223</rs> phase because the high steam pressure of <rs type="material">Hg</rs> lowers the chemical stability in synthesis. However, the doping into <rs type="material">Hg</rs> layers is related to an interstitial oxygen defect. On the other hand, the substitution of Ba by Sr improves the hole doping of CuO2 planes. Thus, the element substitution in <rs type="material">Hg</rs> and Ba sites becomes a key factor in synthesizing high-quality superconductors. Therefore, the cation distribution in the two sites has been examined by the two- wavelengths anomalous dispersion (TWAD) method of synchrotron X-ray resonant scattering. Single crystals of <rs type="material">Hg-1223</rs> were grown at T = 1130 K by the liquid-assisted solid-state recrystallization method from the precursor powder prepared by spray drying or evaporation of the nitrate solutions. Oxygen contents in the precursors were determined by iodometric titrations. Four samples of <rs type="material" xml:id="x6">Hg0.45Pb0.30Ba1.63Sr0.50Ca1.94Cu3O8 (</rs> <rs type="tc">Tc</rs> = <rs corresp="#x6" type="tcValue">128 K</rs>), <rs type="material" xml:id="x2-235">Hg0.42Pb0.41Ba1.19Sr1.06Ca1.97Cu3O8</rs> (<rs corresp="#x2-235" type="tcValue">125 K</rs>), <rs type="material" xml:id="x2-241">Hg0.50Pb0.50Ba0.59Sr1.24Ca1.83Cu3.34O8</rs> (<rs corresp="#x2-241" type="tcValue">116 K</rs>) and <rs type="material" xml:id="x2-247">Hg0.34Pb0.54Ba0.61Sr1.17Ca1.88Cu3O8</rs> (<rs corresp="#x2-247" type="tcValue">115 K</rs>) were selected for single- crystal intensity measurements. A conventional measurement to determine the Ba-site occupancy was made to use a Rigaku AFC-5 four-circle diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation. After the absorption correction by the arbitrary-shape grid-integration method, crystal-structure refinements were successfully performed with R factors ranging 6.4 to 6.7 %. The site preference of <rs type="material">Hg</rs>, <rs type="material">Pb</rs> and <rs type="material">Cu</rs> in the Hg site was determined with a vertical-type four-circle diffractometer in PF-BL-10A, where wavelengths of λ = 1.3906 and 1.0191 Å were used at Cu K and Hg LIII absorption edges, respectively. In the TWAD method with least-squares calculations, a variation of the residual factors gives a minimum against the contents of <rs type="material">Hg</rs> or <rs type="material">Cu</rs>, suggesting, for example, that <rs type="material">Cu</rs> does not occupy the Hg site for all samples. In the presentation the site preference and structural change will be discussed in the aspects of superconductivity.</p>
