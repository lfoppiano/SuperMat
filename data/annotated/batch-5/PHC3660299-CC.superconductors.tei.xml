          <p>We report the high-pressure synthesis of the electron-doped <rs type="class">infinite-layer</rs> superconductor <rs type="material">Sr0.9La0.1CuO2</rs> and its superconducting properties. A Rietveld analysis of X-ray powder diffraction data showed that, within the resolution of the measurement, the sample had purely an infinite-layer structure without any discernible impurities. The superconducting volume fraction and the tran- sition width were greatly improved compared to those in previous reports. The irreversibility field line and the intragranular critical current density were much higher than those of <rs type="material">La1.85Sr0.15CuO4</rs> and <rs type="material">Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO4</rs>. The stronger pinning behaviors are consistent with the strong interlayer coupling due to the short distance between CuO2 planes.</p>

    <p>The electron-doped <rs type="class">infinite-layer compounds</rs> <rs type="material">(Sr +2 1−x Ln +3 x )CuO 2 (Ln = La, Sm, Nd, Gd, etc.)</rs> con- sist of an infinite stacking of CuO 2 planes and metallic (Sr) layers . The charge reservoir block common to other <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductors does not exist in these compounds. Since their structure is so simple, these compounds provide a unique opportunity to explore the fundamental nature of high-temperature superconductor.</p>
    <p>Although electron-doped <rs type="class">infinite-layer compounds</rs> have existed for quite a while, not many studies of their properties have been done because of the lack of high- quality bulk samples. In the case of films of these com- pounds, the <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperatures</rs>, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> , are reported to be much lower than those of bulk sam- ples. For example, the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of a <rs type="material" xml:id="x11">(Sr 1−x Nd x )CuO 2 film</rs> is reduced by about one half compared to that of the bulk . High-pressure synthesis is known to be a unique method that stabilizes the bulk form of <rs type="class">infinite-layer compounds</rs> with larger superconducting volume fractions .</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, several interesting properties have been observed for these compounds. Since the distance be- tween CuO 2 planes is short (3.41Å) due to the absence of the charge reservoir block, the interlayer coupling, and thus the superconductivity is expected to be quite strong. However, the <rs type="tc">T c</rs> is only about <rs corresp="#x11" type="tcValue">43 K</rs>, and neither the ionic radius, the magnetic moment, nor the concen- tration of Ln ions at Sr sites affects <rs type="tc">T c</rs>. Moreover, the oxygen has been found to be very stoichiometric; neither vacancies nor interstitial oxygens exist .</p>
    <p>Pinning is another measure of the strength of interlayer coupling. It has been reported that pinning is enhanced by reducing the thickness of the charge reservoir block . However, the pinning properties of infinite-layer superconductors have not been well studied. Strangely enough, the reported irreversibility field line, H irr , of <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 (La-112)</rs> is more than two times higher than that of <rs type="material">La 1.85 Sr 0.15 CuO 4 (La-214)</rs> while the intra- granular critical current density J c is smaller than that of <rs type="material">La-214</rs>.</p>
    <p>In this research, we used high-quality samples to study the pinning properties of the <rs type="class">infinite-layer</rs> superconduc- tor <rs type="material">La-112</rs>. The superconducting volume fraction and the transition width were determined from the low-field mag- netization data and were found to be improved over pre- viously reported values and a Rietveld analysis of the X-ray powder diffraction data confirmed that the sam- ples were of high quality. The pinning properties were studied by measuring the irreversibility field line and the intragranular critical current density. Contrary to a pre- vious report, both values were higher than those for <rs type="material">La-214</rs> and <rs type="material">Nd 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 4 (Nd-214)</rs>, supporting the stronger interlayer coupling between CuO 2 planes due to the absence of the charge reservoir block.</p>
    <p>A cubic multi-anvil-type press was used to synthesize <rs type="material">La-112</rs> , The precursors were prepared by using the solid-state reaction method , Starting materials of <rs type="material">La 2 O 3</rs> , <rs type="material">SrCO 3</rs> , and <rs type="material">CuO</rs> were mixed to the nominal composition of <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs>. The mixture was then calcined at 950 • C for 36 hours with several intermit- tent grindings. The pelletized precursors sandwiched by Ti oxygen getters were put into a Au capsule in a high- pressure cell. A D-type thermocouple was used to moni- tor the temperature.</p>
        <p>The pressure cell was compressed up to 4 GPa and then heat-treated using a graphite-sleeve heater. The temperature of the Au capsule was calibrated to the heating power, which allowed us to use the heating power to control the temperature. However, much of the power from the power supply was lost to the stray resistance (R stray ∼ 10 −2 Ω ) between the power sup- ply and the graphite heater (R heater ∼ 10 −2 Ω ). Even though the power was supplied at a constant rate by the power supply, the actual heating power of the sample fluctuated because R heater changed during the synthe- sis; ∆R heater /R heater ∼ 0.1. The amount of fluctuation was roughly proportional to R stray /R heater . To solve this problem, we controlled the heating power across the sam- ple, instead of the main power. With this method, a tem- perature stability of ± 2 • C was obtained for a two-hour heating time under high-pressure conditions.</p>
        <p>The heating power was increased linearly and then maintained constant for 2 hours. The synthesizing temperature was about 1000 • C. Then, the sample was quenched to room temperature after an additional postannealing at 500 ∼ 600 • C for 4 hours. Two condi- tions were important in obtaining higher quality samples. One was the long-term stability of the synthesizing tem- perature, and the other was the uniformity of the tem- perature inside the sample cell, the former being more important. The pressure cell and the heating conditions were optimized after hundreds of trials, and very homo- geneous samples larger than 200 mg were obtained. The size of the as-grown polycrystalline samples was about 4.5 mm in diameter and 2.8 mm in height.</p>
    <p>The structure and the grain shape and size were stud- ied by using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measure- ments with Cu Kα radiation, as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy. The struc- tural characterization at room temperature was carried out by using the Rietveld refinement method to ana- lyze the X-ray powder diffraction data. The SEM im- age showed closely packed grains of uniform size with an average radius R &lt; ∼ 5 µm. To investigate the super- conducting properties, we used a SQUID magnetometer (MPMSXL, Quantum Design) to measure magnetization curves M (T ) and M (H). We report our study on the three good samples which are denoted by sample A, sam- ple B, and sample C respectively. While all kinds of data was shown for sample A, only low-field magnetization data was shown for the other two samples.</p>
        <p>The Rietveld refinement profile with the tetragonal space group P4/mmm of our sample is shown in . The value of the diffraction angle 2θ was varied from 20 • to 140 • in steps of 0.02 • , and the integration time was 15 seconds at each point. The Rietveld refinement pro- gram RIETAN-94 with 50 parameters was used for the analysis . In that analysis, the thermal factors were assumed to be isotropic, and the coordination of each atom was fixed. We constrained the Sr : La ratio to the nominal stoichiometry of the precursor . The values obtained for the lattice constants, a = b = 3.950Å and c = 3.410Å, agree quite well, within 0.001Å, with those obtained using neutron powder diffraction . Within the resolution of this refinement, no discernible amounts of impurities were observed. The agreement factors, R, between the measured and the calculated diffraction in- tensities were quite small, and the goodness of fit was excellent (S = 4.0008). The refined structural parame- ters are summarized in</p>
        <p>A structural analysis of an <rs type="class">infinite-layer compound</rs> can also give valuable information about the doping concen- tration because the lattice constants are sensitive to the doping concentration. The lattice constants are known to behave in opposite ways with increased doping; the a-axis expands while the c-axis shrinks . The Rietveld refinement showed that the doping concentration in our <rs type="material">Sr 1−x La x CuO 2</rs> was approximately <rs type="material">x = 0.1</rs>, which was the same as the nominal composition.</p>
    <p>Low-field <rs type="me_method">susceptibility</rs> 4πχ(T ) data for good samples are shown in . In this figure, the curves labeled χ zfc and χ fc were measured in the zero-field-cooled (zfc) and the field-cooled (fc) states, respectively. The nomi- nal superconducting volume fraction was calculated from f nom = −4πχ zfc (T ≪ T c ) and was not corrected for the demagnetization factors . The superconducting vol- ume fractions were higher, especially in the high magnetic field region than previous results .</p>
    <p>The <rs type="tc">superconducting transition onset</rs> in ap- pears at <rs corresp="#x32" type="tcValue">43 K</rs>, which is the value typically reported for the <rs type="material" xml:id="x32">La-112 compound</rs> . However, we can see some notable differences from previous reports. One is a very sharp transition near T = 43 K, and another is a well- developed saturation of the <rs type="me_method">susceptibility</rs> at low temper- atures, which reflects the formation of a high-quality su- perconducting <rs type="material">La-112</rs> phase. The saturated values of 4πχ zfc at low temperatures are about −1.0, −1.17, and −1.22 for samples A, B, and C, respectively.</p>
    <p>For a superconducting sphere with a radius R, 4πχ zfc (T ) is given by the Shoenberg formula −3/2(1 − (3/x) coth x + 3/x 2 ), where x = R/λ avg (T ) and λ avg (T ) is the average magnetic penetration depth, i.e., λ avg = (λ 2 ab λ c ) 1/3 . In the limit of x ≫ 1, the absolute value of −4πχ is not 1, but 1.5, due to the demagnetiza- tion effect . If we take the typical value of λ ∼ 2000 A for high-T c <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> and the grain size R ≃ 5 µm obtained from the SEM image, the value of 4πχ is es- timated to be about −1.3, which is close to the above measured value. Thus, the real superconducting volume fraction of our sample should be close to 100%, especially for sample C. Our values were also confirmed using fine- powdered samples, thus avoiding the possibility of weak links. Also the zfc signal of the low-field magnetization χ zfc (T = 5 K≪ T c ) was basically the same for 100 Oe as it was for 10 Oe, as can be seen in , which was quite typical for all of our samples, irrespective of the sample quality.</p>
    <p>The irreversible field line, H irr (T ), from the high-field magnetization up to 5 T showed that pinning was very strong in the <rs type="class">infinite-layer</rs> <rs type="material" xml:id="x35">La-112</rs> compound. In , the magnetization curves for fields higher than 1 T and the resulting H irr (T ) are presented. The criterion for the reversible point was set as |M zfc − M fc | = 0.1 emu/cm 3 . The irreversible field was fitted with H irr (T)= H 0 (1-T/T c ) n . The best parameters were H 0 = 55.7 T, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> = <rs corresp="#x35" type="tcValue">42.6 K</rs>, and n = 1.99. Our measured value of the irreversible field is about same order of magnitude as previous results .</p>
    <p>Magnetic hysteresis curves M (H) were measured at temperatures between 5 and 30 K, as shown in . The intragranular critical current density was ob- tained from the relation J c ≃ 17(M ↓ −M ↑ )/R, where M ↑ (M ↓ ) is the magnetization in the increasing (decreas- ing) field branch in Gauss (=emu/cm 3 ) and R (∼ 5µm) is the average radius of the grains, and is plotted in (b). Our value of J c is nearly one order of magnitude larger than previous values . As an example, J c (5 K, 4 T) ≈ 1.2 × 10 6 A/cm 2 compared to the previous value of 2 × 10 5 A/cm 2 .</p>
    <p>The choice of R was rather reasonable because the largest grains found in the SEM images on many cleaved surfaces have R max ∼ 7.5 µm, which guarantees the cor- rect order of magnitude of our J c value. Also this J c value was nearly same order of magnitude as that ob- tained for powders using a sieve with the average size R ≃ 3 µm . The high-T c <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductors have strongly 2-dimensional characters, short coherence length, and 'high' <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . Due to these, vortex lines become ill-defined and transform into pancake vortices confined within the CuO 2 planes, which couple only weakly be- tween the layers. Thus the critical current density suf- fers great decrease at higher temperatures due to the flux flow driven by a strong thermal fluctuation effect. There are several extrinsic methods to enhance J c . Correlated defect was known to increase the pinning at higher tem- peratures and high fields while point defects have been known to be efficient only at low temperature and low fields . The former such as columnar defects gen- erated by heavy-ion irradiation not only increases just pinning centers but also could be thought to increase the coupling between vortices along the irradiated trajectory. This is because the relatively strong pinning centers are produced along straight line across CuO 2 plane. The be- havior of J c of <rs type="material">La-112</rs> here resembles the former case, namely the critical current density does not decays fast as temperature and field increases. For example, at T ∼ T c/2, J c decreases by much less than factor of 2 when the field is increased from 1 and 4.5 Tesla, which is just typical behavior expected for Bean's critical state model . Correlated defects are generally inserted into the sample on purpose, surely absent in our samples. All these arguments suggest that the behavior of J c of our sample is highly intrinsic because Jorgensen et al. showed that defects, most probably the oxygen defects and va- cancies, do not exist for this compound .</p>
    <p>The samples studied here were made with in-situ an- nealing and showed that the nearly uniform-sized grains were separated well from each other by wide cracks. The uniform size made the superconducting transition sharp in the low-field magnetization, and the cracks made the resistivity drop in the transport measurement nearly in- visible. Actually we tried to make samples without in- situ annealing after sintering. This sample showed many smaller grains between larger grains, which resulted in broad superconducting transition in the low-field mag- netization but with a clearer resistivity drop due to a better connectivity between the grains. These suggest that the use of grain radius not the sample radius is rea- sonable for the calculation of J c like the previous report . The different J c values between us and previous re- sult seems to be partly due to the uniformness of the grain size and/or the existence of many smaller grains. Now let's compare the above values with those of com- pounds having a charge reservoir block, whose average distance between CuO 2 planes is larger. Optimally doped <rs type="material">(La,Sr) 2 CuO 4</rs> and <rs type="material">(Nd,Ce) 2 CuO 4</rs> are the most suitable for comparison with our electron-doped infinite-layer su- perconductors because the former has nearly the same <rs type="tc">T c</rs> as our sample while the latter is an electron-doped <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductor similar to ours.</p>
    <p>First, H irr (T /T c ) of <rs type="material">La-112</rs> is more than 2 times higher than that of <rs type="material">(La,Sr) 2 CuO 4</rs> and one order of magnitude larger than that of <rs type="material">Nd-214</rs> . Similarly, our mea- sured value of J c for the <rs type="material">La-112</rs> compound is much higher than the value reported for <rs type="material">polycrystalline La-214</rs>, J c ≃ 1.7 × 10 5 A/cm 2 at 4.2 K and 4 T . As for the <rs type="material">Nd-214</rs> compound, the reported J c ≃ 8 × 10 5 A/cm 2 at 4.2 K and 0 T was obtained using a form of only a thin film not a bulk, so a direct comparison is impossible. However, if the fact that the J c of high-T c <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> de- creases by nearly one order of magnitude when the mag- netic field is increased from 0 to ∼ 5 T is considered, the intragranular critical current density of <rs type="material">La-112</rs> should be much larger than that of <rs type="material">Nd-214</rs>.</p>
    <p>The above comparisons of H irr (T ) and J c support the conclusion that the interlayer coupling of an infinite-layer superconductor is stronger due to the absence of a charge reservoir block. Such a stronger interlayer coupling was also found with previous observation of the 3D antifer- romagnetic structure for an undoped infinite-layer com- pound, i.e., <rs type="material">Ca 0.85 Sr 0.15 CuO 2</rs> . This material has been reported to have a stronger 3-dimensional character than other parent insulators of cuprate superconductors, such as <rs type="material">YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6</rs> , <rs type="material">La 2 CuO 4</rs> , and <rs type="material">Sr 2 CuO 2 Cl 2</rs> . For example, an estimate of the ratio of the out-of-plane and the in-plane coupling constants for <rs type="material">Ca 0.85 Sr 0.15 CuO 2</rs> was two to three orders of magnitude larger than correspond- ing values for <rs type="material">YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6</rs> and <rs type="material">La 2 CuO 4</rs> . From our study, we claim that the pinning properties of high-T c <rs type="class">cuprates</rs> is improved at the extreme limit of reducing the thickness of the charger reservoir block, i.e, at a cuprate superconductor without a charger reservoir block.</p>
    <p>We synthesized the <rs type="class">infinite-layer compound</rs> <rs type="material">Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2</rs> . The quality of the samples was con- firmed by using a structural analysis and low-field mag- netization measurements. Both the irreversibility field, H irr (T ), and the intragranular critical current density, J c , were found to be much higher than the values for <rs type="material">(La,Sr) 2 CuO 4</rs> and <rs type="material">(Nd,Ce) 2 CuO 4</rs>. And J c does not de- cay fast as temperatrue and magnetic field increases, unlike other <rs type="class">cuprate</rs> superconductors. These indicats an enhanced interlayer coupling between the CuO 2 planes due to a shortening of the c-axis lattice constant.</p>
