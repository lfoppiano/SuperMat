Temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth in B 1−x K x BiO 3 superconductor 
Temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth, λ(T), was measured in the Meissner state in single crystals B1−xKxBiO3 (x=0.37) using tunnel diode resonator technique. At low temperatures, 0.013 ≤ T /Tc ≤ 0.4, λ(T) is exponentially flat, which provides a strong evidence for conventional s-wave BCS behavior. Numerical analysis of the data rules out the possibility of a gap with nodes. 
Magnetic penetration depth is an effective tool to study electromagnetic properties of superconductors. At low temperatures, its temperature dependence is directly related to the density of low energy quasiparticles, which in turn can be related to the anisotropy of the superconducting energy gap on the Fermi surface. For investigation of the low lying excitations and thus the anisotropy of the energy gap, the analysis is considerably less ambiguous if measurements are performed on high quality single crystal and temperatures well below T c /3. In this paper we report magnetic penetration depth measurements on single crystals B 0.63 K 0.37 BiO 3 (T c ≈ 31 K) down to 0.4 K. The investigation of mechanisms of superconductivity in B 1−x K x BiO 3 (BKBO) system has been one of the important subjects in studies of high T c superconductivity in oxide materials. The significance of BKBO lies in observations that some of its superconducting properties are consistent with the conventional s-wave isotropic superconductivity, but others are resembling high-T c cuprates. In particular, substantial isotope effect , strong phonon contribution from the neutron scattering measurements , and a superconducting gap with 2∆ 0 /T c =3.5±0.3 from the tunnelling and optical experiments indicate significant role of electron-phonon interactions in mechanism of superconductivity of BKBO. However the low density of states at the Fermi level with T c as high as 30K and insulator-superconductor transition by doping are similar to high-T c cuprates. However, in contrast to high T c cuprates which have two dimensional CuO 2 planes, BKBO has simple three dimensional cubic perovskite structure. 
Single crystal of B 1−x K x BiO 3 (x=0.37) was grown by the electro-chemical method reported elsewhere . DC magnetization was measured by using Quantum Design MPMS SQUID magnetometer. Zero-field cooled and field cooled temperature scans taken in external field of 10 Oe are shown in 
Superconducting transition temperature of the sample is T c ≈ 31K and the curves show regular superconducting screening with the Meissner expulsion of about 20%, which provides an indication of relatively low pinning.

Penetration depth measurements were carried out using a 13 MHz tunnel diode LC resonator mounted on a He 3 cryostat. The sample was placed on the sapphire stage with temperature control from 0.35 to 40K. During the measurements the sample is exposed to the small ac field H ac ≃ 20 mOe much less than the first critical field, H c1 ≈ 750 Oe at 5 K . The relative resonance frequency shift, ∆f = f (T ) − f (T min ), is related to the change of the magnetic penetration depth via ∆f = −G∆λ, where G is geometrical factor that depends upon the sample shape and volume as well as the coil geometry . Low temperature behavior of magnetic penetration depth is shown in the . The frequency shift in was normalized by the value ∆f 0 ≈ 3500 Hz, which represents the total frequency shift cooling from normal to superconducting state.

Dash-dotted line represents low temperature d -wave behavior. See text for details. Here ∆ 0 is the value of the energy gap at zero temperature . The fitting range was chosen up to 0.33T c to ensure the validity of the low temperature expansion. 2∆ 0 /T c = 3.53 corresponds to standard weak coupling BCS value. The dash-dotted line shows the low temperature behavior of the magnetic penetration depth predicted for a clean d-wave superconductor . The value of 2∆ 0 /T c for d-wave case was again chosen to be 3.53 in accordance with results of tunnelling and optical experiments. 
∆λ ≈ λ(0) 1 − ln 2 ∆ 0 T Clearly the isotropic s-wave BCS curve provides best description of the low temperature penetration depth variation indicating the isotropic nature of superconducting gap for BKBO. Some apparent noise in the data is because in the temperature interval of interest, the penetration depth is exponentially flat with no systematic temperature dependence.
