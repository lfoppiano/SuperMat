While the enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature is established, the character of the electronic states induced by indium doping remains poorly understood. We report a study of magneto-transport in a series of Sn1\u2212xInxTe single crystals with 0.1 \u2264 x \u2264 0.45. From measurements of the Hall effect, we find that the dominant carrier type changes from hole-like to electron-like at x \u223c 0.25; one would expect electron-like carriers if the In ions have a valence of +3. For single crystals with x = 0.45, corresponding to the highest superconducting transition temperature, pronounced Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are observed in the normal state. In measurements of magnetoresistance, we find evidence for weak anti-localization (WAL). We attribute both the quantum oscillations and the WAL to bulk Dirac-like hole pockets, previously observed in photoemission studies, which coexist with the dominant electron-like carriers.", "authors": [{"first": "Cheng", "surname": "Zhang"}, {"first": "Xu-Gang", "surname": "He"}, {"first": "Hang", "surname": "Chi"}, {"first": "Ruidan", "surname": "Zhong"}, {"first": "Wei", "surname": "Ku"}, {"first": "Genda", "surname": "Gu"}, {"first": "J", "middle": "M", "surname": "Tranquada"}, {"first": "Qiang", "surname": "Li"}, {}, {}, {}], "keywords": [], "npl_publn_id": "1802.09882-CC.tei.xml"}
