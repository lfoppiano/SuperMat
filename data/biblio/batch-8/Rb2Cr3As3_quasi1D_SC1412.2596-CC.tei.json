K. Bao et al., arXiv: 1412.0067 (2014)], we succeeded in synthesizing an analogous compound, Rb2Cr3As3, which also crystallizes in a hexagonal lattice. The replacement of K by Rb results in an expansion of a axis by 3%, suggesting weaker interchain coupling. Linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity shows up between 5 to 35 K, and bulk superconductivity emerges at 4.8 K. The estimated upper critical field at zero temperature exceeds the Pauli limit by a factor of two. Furthermore, the electronic specific-heat coefficient in the mixed state increases with \u221a H, indicating existence of nodes in the superconducting gap. Hence Rb2Cr3As3 manifests itself as another example of unconventional superconductivity in the Cr3As3chain based systems.", "authors": [{"first": "Zhang-Tu", "surname": "Tang"}, {"first": "Jin-Ke", "surname": "Bao"}, {"first": "Yi", "surname": "Liu"}, {"first": "Yun-Lei", "surname": "Sun"}, {"first": "Abduweli", "surname": "Ablimit"}, {"first": "Hui-Fei", "surname": "Zhai"}, {"first": "Hao", "surname": "Jiang"}, {"first": "Chun-Mu", "surname": "Feng"}, {"first": "Zhu-An", "surname": "Xu"}, {"first": "Guang-Han", "surname": "Cao"}], "keywords": ["numbers: 74.70.-b", "74.62.Bf", "74.25.Bt"], "npl_publn_id": "Rb2Cr3As3_quasi1D_SC1412.2596-CC.tei.xml"}
