{"title_a": "Unconventional interfacial superconductivity in epitaxial Bi/Ni heterostructures", "abstract": "Superconductivity (SC) is one of the most intriguing physical phenomena in nature. Nucleation of SC has long been considered highly unfavorable if not impossible near ferromagnetism (FM) 1-5 , in low dimensionality 6,7 and, above all, out of non-superconductor. Here we report observation of SC with TC near 4 K in Ni/Bi bilayers that defies all known", "authors": [{"first": "Xin-Xin", "surname": "Gong"}, {"first": "Hexin", "surname": "Zhou"}, {"first": "Peng-Chao", "surname": "Xu"}, {"first": "Di", "surname": "Yue"}, {"first": "Kai", "surname": "Zhu"}, {"first": "Xiaofeng", "surname": "Jin"}, {"first": "He", "surname": "Tian"}, {"first": "Gejian", "surname": "Zhao"}, {"first": "Ting-Yong", "surname": "Chen"}], "keywords": [], "npl_publn_id": "Tc4k_interfaceBi_Ni-CC.tei.xml"}
